<h1>Frame Plans Introduction</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Frame Plans can be created at any stage of the design process. They 
 can be developed for a specific design or for a series of designs or colourways 
 by using the <a href="Locking_Frames.htm">Locking</a> feature.</p>
<p>If frame plans are not locked they will normally automatically update 
 as changes are made to the design and if there are more colours used in 
 an end than there are frames available then error frames are created to 
 hold the colours which cannot be planted. It is thus easy to check for 
 errors visually.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The preference Automatic Update Frame 
 plans must be selected in order for frame plans to automatically update 
 as the design is edited.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Planting</span></p>
<p>Planting refers to the placing of more than one colour in a frame. There 
 are 3 different strategies for planting:</p>
<p><a href="CarpetCreating_an_Initial_Frame_Plan.htm#Planting_None">None</a>: 
 i.e. full frames (one colour per frame).</p>
<p><a href="CarpetCreating_an_Initial_Frame_Plan.htm#Smart_Plant">Smart 
 Plant</a> allows specification of one preferred frame for planting and 
 is therefore suitable for most woven carpet designs.</p>
<p><a href="Frames_Custom_Config.htm">Custom Planting</a> allows specification 
 of priorities for placement of Colour in Frames</p>
<p>Frame Plans can always be edited manually - this is not affected by 
 the option chosen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom Planting</span></p>
<p>Each color can have a priority number for each frame. Thus, for example, 
 a color in an 8 frame design could have priority number 1 as Frame 4, 
 priority number 2 as frame 8 etc. Obviously the maximum length of the 
 sequence, for each color, is the same as the number of frames.</p>
<p>See the topic <a href="Frames_Custom_Config.htm">Custom Planting</a> 
 for more information.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Checking Frames</span></p>
<p>You can confirm that a Frame Plan is correct by using the Frame Check 
 option.</p>
<p>If you want to delete the frame plan, select Frames-&gt;Delete. If you 
 want to delete your existing plan and <a href="CarpetCreating_an_Initial_Frame_Plan.htm">create</a> 
 a new one  just select Create from the Frames menu. There is no need 
 to delete your current plan first as it will be deleted when you select 
 Create.</p>
<p>If you just want to remove the frame plan from your screen, but dont 
 want to delete it  simply de-select Frames-&gt;Frame Window.</p>
<p>See the topic <a href="Checking_for_Errors.htm">Checking for Errors</a> 
 for more information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Locked Frames</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is normally used where a frame 
 plan is common to several different designs or colourways. A special checking 
 system allows errors (for a particular design) to be marked in the design 
 (i.e. colours not present in the frame plan in a particular end) and can 
 also be marked in the frame plan (colours not used in the design).</span></p>
<p>See the topic <a href="Locking_Frames.htm">Locking Frames</a> for more 
 information.</p>
