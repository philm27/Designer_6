<h1>Tutorials Introduction</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Tutorials allow you to become familiar with some of the commonly 
 used software features by actually creating a design from the beginning 
 and saving it so that you are then in a position to create designs of 
 your own.</p>
<p>To become proficient in the use of the APSO software will obviously 
 take a lot of practice but the tutorials should start you off in the right 
 direction so that you can then use the help files as and when necessary 
 to fill in the gaps in your knowledge.</p>
<p>There are two Tutorials in this section:</p>
<p><a href="Tutorial_1.htm">Tutorial 1</a> is a basic introduction to creating 
 and saving a simple design and frame plan.</p>
<p><a href="Tutorial_2.htm">Tutorial 2</a> guides the user through the 
 creation of a more complex traditional repeating design and a variation 
 of it.</p>
<p><a href="Tutorial_3.htm">Tutorial 3</a> uses the designs created in 
 Tutorial 2 to create a border design and 2 variations of a rug with border 
 and mitred corners.</p>
