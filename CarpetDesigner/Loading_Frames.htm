<h1>Loading Frames</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Frames can be loaded from other designs using the menu option Frames-&gt;Load 
 Frame Plan. A standard Open File Dialog will then allow you to select 
 a file. If this file has a frame plan it will become the current design's 
 frame plan. The current design will be unaffected.</p>
<p>The frame plan may be automatically locked or you may be prompted to 
 lock the frame (see <a href="Locking_Frames.htm">Locking Frames</a>) depending 
 on the preference setting.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Palette</span></p>
<p>The palette used is always that of the current design. The frame plan 
 will be re-coloured according to the current design palette. For example 
 if the frame plan was saved with colour 5 in frame 7, then after loading 
 the frame plan, frame 7 will be recoloured using palette colour 5 from 
 the current design palette.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion therefore, it is best if the frame plan and current 
 design have the same palette. However, it is quite easy to load a frame 
 plan from a design which is simply a recoloured version of the current 
 design, providing the corresponding colours are in the same position in 
 the palette e.g. if both palettes are in usage order.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Size Differences</span></p>
<p>If you have loaded a new frame plan into the design through either method, 
 it will be resized to match the design width and the number of colours 
 in the palette may be increased to match the colours in the frame.</p>
