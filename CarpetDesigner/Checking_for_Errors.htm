<h1>Checking for Frame Plan Errors</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The procedure for checking for errors really depends on the setting 
 of the Automatic Refresh flag. If you have set this flag then the frame 
 plan is updated automatically every time you edit the design. If it is 
 not then you must correct any errors manually.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Errors are colours missing from a 
 frame plan in a particular end. The software will not report an error 
 if a colour is not in the correct frame according to the custom planting 
 dialog or the specified frame order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If a frame plan is locked, then errors 
 are not automatically corrected regardless of the preference setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Check<a name="Quick_Check" id="Quick_Check"></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The easiest and quickest way of checking 
 the frame plan is to select the menu item Frames-&gt;Check. This will 
 display a message indicating whether there are any errors or not. If the 
 Frame plan is not currently being viewed, it will be switched into view 
 mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">An error will be reported if any 
 of the following are true:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">There are colours 
	 in error frames.</span></p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">One or more ends 
	 in the design contains a colour which is not present in the corresponding 
	 end in the frame plan.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If a colour is present in a position 
 which is not actually required, this will not be reported as an error. 
 This means that you can have a single frame plan which is used by several 
 designs. The frame plan can be loaded (see the topic <a href="Loading_Frames.htm">Loading 
 Frames</a> and <a href="Locking_Frames.htm">Locking Frames</a>) and checked 
 against each design.</span></p>
<p>Although you can check frames visually (see below) it is worth getting 
 into the habit of doing this check as described here before saving a design 
 as a confirmation that the frame plan is correct.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual Check<a name="Visual_Check" 
													 id="Visual_Check"></a></span></p>
<p>If you have created a frame plan or if you have selected the Automatic 
 refresh option and the Frame plan is Unlocked, then the frame plan will 
 have been updated each time a design edit is done and so you can check 
 visually for error frames at any time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Checking_Errors2.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; 
									 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; 
									 margin-right: 0px;" width="288" height="225" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">Example 
 of a section of a frame plan showing error frames (outlined in red). Since 
 the 8 actual frames are full, the red and pink colours must be removed 
 from the design in this area as they cannot be planted. Alternatively 
 of course, other colours could be removed from the design to make space 
 for the red and pink.</span></p>
<p>Error frames<a name="Error_frames" id="Error_frames"></a> indicate where 
 a colour is used in the design in an end but is not yet placed into a 
 frame. Error frames will always contain 1 colour per &quot;frame&quot;. 
 If you see 3 error frames then there are 3 colours for which errors exist.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Locked Frame Plan Checks<a name="Locked_Frame_Plan_Checks" 
	 id="Locked_Frame_Plan_Checks"></a></span></p>
<p>Select Frames-&gt;Frame Locking-&gt;Lock Frames in order to prevent 
 the software automatically updating the frame plan and to enable the following 
 two options.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Design Errors<a 
	 name="Show_Design_Errors" id="Show_Design_Errors"></a></span> - Select 
	 this option to mark all points in the design where a colour is used 
	 that is not present in the frame plan. This may be switched on and 
	 off using the same menu item. The mark consists of diagonal yellow 
	 lines, similar to the protected areas display.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Unused Frames<a 
	 name="Show_Unused_Frames" id="Show_Unused_Frames"></a> -</span> <span 
	 style="font-weight: normal;">Select this option to mark points in 
	 the frame plan at which a colour has been placed but which is not 
	 actually required for this design. (Each &quot;point&quot; in the 
	 frame plan represents a peg; or the bobbin colour if present). Again, 
	 an unused bobbin will be marked by diagonal yellow lines. This feature 
	 may be switched off by selecting the same menu item.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><img 
	 src="Checking_Errors1.gif" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; 
	 margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" 
	 width="402" height="233" border="1" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 8.0pt;">Example of the 
 &quot;Show Design Errors&quot; and &quot;Show Unused Frames&quot; options. 
 Note the 3 marked points in the frame plan indicating unused bobbins and 
 the marked area in the design which does not have corresponding blue bobbins 
 in the frame plan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note that you can easily move forwards and 
 backwards through the design errors by pressing * and / on the numeric 
 keypad. The software will bring each design point in error to the centre 
 of the design window going down each end presenting each separate block 
 of errors in turn and working from left to right. This is particularly 
 helpful if there are just one or two small errors in a large design, as 
 it is not easy to see the errors otherwise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Remove errors by normal design changes or 
 by editing the frame plan (see the topic <a href="Frame_Edit.htm">Frame 
 Edit</a>).</p>
