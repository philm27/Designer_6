<h1><span style="font-weight: normal;">Saving the Frame Plan</span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whenever you save your design the frame plan will automatically be saved 
 with it provided it is saved as an IFF or PRJ file. The software will 
 also save the Custom Frame Plan configuration.</p>
<p>However, you can use the option <a href="CarpetSaving_Plant_Guides_as_IFF_Files.htm">Save 
 Frame Plan</a> to save the frame plan together with a special version 
 of the design which acts as a plant guide (can be used in Axminster and 
 Wilton to verify planting is correct at loom). For more information about 
 plant Guides see the topic <a href="CarpetSaving_Plant_Guides_as_IFF_Files.htm">Saving 
 Plant Guides as IFF Files</a>.</p>
<p>Saving a Frame plan separately is also useful when it is to be used 
 for several different designs. It can then be loaded and checked against 
 those other designs.</p>
<p>A standard dialog will be displayed allowing selection of a directory 
 and a file name. Following the save, the project name will be unchanged 
 (unlike a normal design save).</p>
<p>If you save your design as a .PAT file the frame plan is automatically 
 saved as a separate .CPD file with the same file name.</p>
