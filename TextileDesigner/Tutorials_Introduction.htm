<h1>Tutorials Introduction</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Tutorials allow you to become familiar with some of the commonly 
 used software features by actually creating a design and saving it so 
 that you are then in a position to create designs of your own.</p>
<p>To become proficient in the use of the APSO software will obviously 
 take a lot of practice but the tutorials should start you off in the right 
 direction so that you can then use the help files as and when necessary 
 to fill in the gaps in your knowledge.</p>
<p>There are four Tutorials. 1 and 2 are textile oriented. 3 and 4 are 
 carpet oriented though they will all be of general interest to designers 
 as they all use a variety of techniques.</p>
<p><a href="Textile_Tutorial_1.htm">Tutorial 1</a> is a basic introduction 
 to creating and saving artwork.</p>
<p><a href="Textile_Tutorial_2.htm">Tutorial 2</a> is a more complex design 
 and again takes you through to the artwork stage.</p>
<p><a href="Textile_Tutorial_3.htm">Tutorial 3</a> creates a medallion 
 design in a repeating field and a variation of it.</p>
<p>Tutorial 4 creates a rug by using and developing the field design created 
 in the preceding tutorial.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Tutorial 3 takes the design created in Tutorial 2 and applies weaves 
 to it.</p>
