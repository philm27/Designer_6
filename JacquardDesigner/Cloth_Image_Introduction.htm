<h1>Cloth Image Introduction</h1>
<p>The Cloth Image will appear in its own document which is part of the 
 Design Project in a similar way to the Weave Editor and Print Layout Documents.</p>
<p>It can be displayed (after you have Applied Weaves and there are valid 
 warp and weft threading plans) by selecting &quot;Cloth Mode&quot; on 
 the Jacquard menu or by selecting the &quot;Cloth Mode&quot; button on 
 the Jacquard tool bar.</p>
<p>While displaying the cloth image you can modify the threading plan in 
 the warp and weft bars but, as for the Weave Editor, there are safety 
 procedures built in so that it should not be possible to make changes 
 by mistake.</p>
<p>A typical Cloth Document might look something like this:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ClothWindow_001.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">An example 
 cloth image for a design featuring weft figuring. Because of the small 
 design and sett, the colors cannot be seen in the warp and weft bars but 
 the image can be zoomed as in the next example</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;"><img 
	 src="ClothWindow_002.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">Example 
 of the same cloth image zoomed. Note that the artwork thumbnail on the 
 right indicates the design section being shown with a red rectangle. At 
 this zoom level it is practical to make changes to the yarn and cramming 
 marks using the mouse.</p>
