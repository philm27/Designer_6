<h1>Weft Controls</h1>
<p>Select &quot;Weft Controls...&quot; on the Pop-up menu. This should 
 display the Weft Controls Dialog.</p>
<p>Note that this option is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> 
 available in Merge View.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="WeftControls_001.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">Example 
 of the Weft Controls Dialog. In this example controls ABC and F have been 
 selected.</p>
<p>Use this dialog to nominate which controls are shown and possibly edited 
 in the main Weave Edit window. Click on one or more letters in the left 
 column then &quot;&gt;&quot; to move them across to the selected list 
 on the right. You can also move one or more letters out of the selected 
 list by selecting those letters you wish to remove and clicking the &quot;&lt;&quot; 
 button.</p>
<p>When the OK button is clicked, the software will check if there are 
 any controls used in the design that are not going to be displayed.</p>
<p>After clicking the OK button, the weave edit window will be modified 
 to show the selected controls as in the example below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="WeaveEditor_002.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">Part 
 of a weave edit window showing crammed threads at pick 7, 9, 11 etc (indicated 
 by &quot;+&quot; on top of the thread color) and weft controls ABC and 
 F with F being used on picks 1, 2 and 3 and A being used in pick 4. In 
 this example there is a gap between picks and picks relating to the same 
 artwork row are &quot;Grouped&quot; e.g. picks 1-5 relate to artwork rows 
 1-5 and picks 6 and 7 relate to artwork row 6. The artwork is shown in 
 the background (a broad grey curve can be seen at the top right surrounding 
 an area of blue weft floats).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Display</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The display only shows a subset of the 
 26 possible as it is highly unlikely that more than 3 or 4 will be required. 
 but note that there could be others that are used but not shown (see the 
 comments for the Controls dialog above).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Control Setting</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Simply click on a letter using the Left 
 hand mouse button to set a control. Click using the right hand mouse button 
 to unset a control. Controls that have been selected are shown in red, 
 unused controls are in light blue.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Controls and their Meaning</p>
<p>The meaning of these controls ABC...Z is ultimately dependant on which 
 hooks they lift or electronic signals they set in the loom file created 
 from this data.</p>
<p>For example F might lift hook 12 which, at the loom, might be a fringe 
 mechanism; A, B and C might be changes of pick rate etc.</p>
<p>These &quot;connections&quot; between a letter and a loom function are 
 set up in the Looms Maintenance software and can thus, in theory, be a 
 different hook or electronic signal at each loom or loom group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Threading Plan</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Note that the controls and cramming information 
 may also be set and edited as part of the Threading Plan. See the topic 
 <a href="Warp_Threading.htm">Threading Sequence</a>.</p>
