<h1>Denting Plans</h1>
<p>To edit a denting plan using conventional brackets and repeating sequences, 
 select Denting Plan on the Pop-up menu (right click in an empty area in 
 the Weave Editor display).</p>
<p>This will display a dialog similar to the one below.</p>
<p>Users familiar with Denting Plans in Dobby Designer will find that this 
 dialog is used in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="DentingPlan_001.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">An example of a Denting 
 Plan consisting of 4 ends sleyed in 2's and then 156 ends sleyed in 3's 
 (6 ends sleyed in 3's repeated 26 times).</p>
<p>The plan shows marks (in red) in two rows with each column representing 
 an end and alternate dents being shown on the upper row then the lower 
 row. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Editing the Plan</p>
<p>Edit the plan using the mouse to move a red mark from one row to another.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Making a bracket</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Simply click in the first column on the 
 &quot;times&quot; row (where x26 is in the example above), and type the 
 times value and press return (or click in another location). You do not 
 need to type the &quot;x&quot;.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The software will automatically insert 
 the x if not typed and will create a single column bracket (or a wider 
 one if there is already a bracket at a lower level).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Making brackets wider</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Move the cursor to the end of the bracket 
 (i.e. click in that position or move the cursor using the cursor keys 
 on the keyboard), then use the &quot;&lt;&quot; and the &quot;&gt;&quot; 
 keys to move the end of the bracket left or right. As well as making a 
 bracket wider you can reduce the bracket width in this way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Adding columns to the Plan</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">You can use the buttons in the dedicated 
 toolbar, as shown in the image above, to add columns or to delete them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Inserting a column</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Simply select a location - you do not need 
 to select the whole column - and click on the Insert Column button. You 
 can insert several columns at once by making a selection covering more 
 than 1 column. Thus make a selection covering 3 columns and click on Insert 
 Column in order to insert 3 new columns in front of the first one selected.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Duplicating Columns</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Make a selection covering the columns to 
 be duplicated - you do not need to select the whole height of &#160;these 
 columns - and click on the Duplicate Column button. Thus make a selection 
 covering 3 columns and click on Duplicate Column in order to duplicate 
 those 3 columns.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Delete Columns</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Make 
 a selection covering the columns to be deleted - again, you do not need 
 to select the whole height of &#160;these columns - and click on the Delete 
 Column button.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Undo and Redo</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">You can undo and redo up to 60 actions 
 using the buttons on the toolbar or by typing ctrl+Z or ctrl+Y as normal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Pop-up Menu</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Right Click anywhere in the plan to display 
 a pop-up menu with further options as well as those discussed above.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Number of Ends</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The number of ends in the plan is displayed 
 on the right hand side and this figure will be updated as changes are 
 made. The plan should have the same number of ends as the width of the 
 weave in the Weave Editor. If this is not the case when you click on the 
 OK button, the software will prompt you with the option to either automatically 
 make up the plan to the required number of ends or to remove ends as appropriate.</p>
