<h1>Export for Carpet and Pile Fabric Users</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This topic is intended to be read 
 by carpet designers and pile fabric designers who need to use Jacquard 
 Designer to create files for</span> <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">electronic 
 jacquards or electronic punch machines</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">via 
 the export feature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">An example of this export type is 
 the .bin files for the Staubli punch machines or .ep files for Van de 
 Wiele electronic jacquards. These features are optional extras and may 
 not be enabled in your copy of the software.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When to use Jacquard Designer</span></p>
<p>If a design requires special effects you must use Jacquard Designer. 
 Special effects in this case refer to features like &quot;Keep over 2 
 wires&quot; etc. If it is simply a case of using &quot;Through to Back&quot; 
 instead of &quot;Not through to Back&quot; or a similar overall change 
 in the weaves then this can be accomplished by creating a separate Format 
 File and then using Carpet Designer to export the files which is slightly 
 easier than applying weaves in the Jacquard program. See the topic <a 
	 href="DesignerExport.chm::/Export_-_Format_Files.htm">Format Files</a>.</p>
<p>It is the &quot;Weave&quot; in the IFF file which is exported to the 
 .bin or .ep file. The exported files do not contain any original artwork.</p>
<p>If a change is made to the design, or if frame numbers have changed, 
 then the weaves must obviously be re-applied, the IFF file re-saved and 
 the .bin or .ep files, re-exported.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outline Procedure</span></p>
<ol>
	<li class="p"><p>Create the design as normal using a different color 
	 for each frame but also for each special effect for each frame.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>You must now apply weaves to the design to create 
	 the weave pattern.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>In some cases you may wish to do the weave <a href="Weave_Adjustments.htm">adjustments</a> 
	 at this stage using the option on the Jacquard menu.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>You can now use the menu option Export -&gt; BIN File 
	 to create .bin files.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Producing the Design</span></p>
<p>As noted earlier the design i.e. the &quot;Artwork&quot; can be produced 
 in either Jacquard Designer or Carpet Designer as there is no difference 
 between the two as far as drawing features are concerned and designs may 
 be loaded into either program having been created in the other.</p>
<p>However, in order to apply weaves you must, of course, use the Jacquard 
 Designer program.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Design Colors</span></p>
<p>You must use a separate design color for each different weave which 
 equates to having a different color for each effect for each frame.</p>
<p>For example if frame 1 has 3 different effects and each of frames 2 
 and 3 have 2 effects then 7 design colors must be used. You can of course 
 use similar colors so you could for example use a dark red where frame 
 1 is lifted over 2 wires and a lighter red where frame 1 is lifted over 
 a single wire.</p>
<p>Of course if planting occurs then the situation will be even more complicated 
 as you may wish to use even more colors in order to illustrate what the 
 design actually looks like. In this case you will probably apply the same 
 weave to more than 1 palette color.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preferences</span></p>
<p>It is recommended that all the following preferences are set (see the 
 topic <a href="Jacquard_Preferences.htm">Jacquard Preferences</a>).</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>Wilton Dialogs and Messages</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Disable &quot;Apply Simple Weaves&quot;</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Align Single Dent Weaves with start of motif.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is particularly important that you select the Alignment preference 
 when using weaves which are one dent wide and 4 or 6 picks long such as 
 double or treble loops so that they are aligned with the start of the 
 motif.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Apply Weaves</span></p>
<p>The weaves in most cases will have been pre-designed and each weave 
 represents an effect.</p>
<p>Black (or the darkest colour in the weave) represents a &quot;hole&quot; 
 in the card (or a lift in the case of electronic jacquard) and white represents 
 &quot;no hole&quot; (or a drop).</p>
<p>It is recommended that a different directory is used for each type of 
 weave for example you could have a directory for 3 frame Paper looms, 
 5 frame Paper loom, 3 frame VDW NTTB, 3 frame VDW TW, 3 frame VDW SW etc.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note that more information about the 
 Apply Weaves dialog is given in the topic</span> <a href="Apply_Weaves_Composite.htm"><span 
	 style="font-style: italic;">Apply Weaves Composite</span></a><span 
	 style="font-style: italic;">. The following describes the outline 
 procedure for wilton and pile fabric designer.</span></p>
<p>To apply weaves select the menu option Jacquard -&gt; Apply Weaves -&gt; 
 Composite. You should see the following dialog. (Do not select the very 
 similar Apply Weaves Simple).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ExportApplyWeave1.gif" alt="" 
									 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; 
									 margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" 
									 width="533" height="287" border="0" /></p>
<p>Double click the colour in the list of colours and weaves, OR, select 
 it (so it is highlighted in blue as line 1 above) then right click and 
 select Open from the Pop-up menu.</p>
<p>A standard &quot;Open File&quot; dialog will be shown as in the example 
 below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="WeaveOpen_002.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; 
									 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; 
									 margin-right: 0px;" width="614" height="336" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For more details about the <a href="DesignerBase.chm::/CarpetFinding_a_Design_to_Open.htm">Open 
 File</a> dialog follow this link</p>
<p>Simply navigate to the required directory, if necessary, so that you 
 can see the required weave file (.iff).</p>
<p>You can either double click on the weave file (e.g. P3-F1.IFF) or you 
 can select it then click on the Open button.</p>
<p>Repeat the above procedure for each color. The dialog should look something 
 like the one shown below with a weave beside each color.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ExportApplyWeave3.gif" alt="" 
									 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; 
									 margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" 
									 width="533" height="287" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">This 
 is the same example as above, after the weaves have been selected. Note 
 that the third line is selected and the weave shown on the left is P3-F3 
 for a normal frame 3 selection for the 3 frame loom.</span></p>
<p>When all weaves have been allocated click on Apply Weaves. The small 
 dialog shown here should be displayed:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ExportApplyWeave4.gif" alt="" 
									 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; 
									 margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" 
									 width="285" height="204" border="0" /></p>
<p>Set the two figures in the small dialog to the width of each dent in 
 control points (the width multiplier) and the number of picks in a design 
 row (the length multiplier).</p>
<p>For example if there are two holes per frame (because it is a 3 position 
 selection mechanism) and 3 frames then the width multiplier will be 6.</p>
<p>The length multiplier is normally 2 but may in some cases be only 1.</p>
<p>Click on OK. The weaves will be applied and you will be returned to 
 the main design screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mode</span></p>
<p>Immediately after applying weaves, the program will show the Weave view 
 of the design - expanded and in black and white weave form. You can switch 
 to the design view by selecting menu option Mode-&gt;Artwork or back to 
 the weave view by selecting Mode-&gt;Weave (both on the Jacquard menu).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Errors</span></p>
<p>If you have made an earlier mistake such as setting the multiplier values 
 incorrectly (e.g. entering 5 and 1 instead of 6 and 2) or perhaps setting 
 the wrong weave against the wrong color, you can correct your mistake 
 and re-apply weaves at any time.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adjust Weave</span></p>
<p>For the electronic Jacquards, certain weave adjustments are recommended 
 by Van de Wiele and you may wish to do this at this stage. A useful benefit 
 of using the Adjust Weaves option on the Jacquard menu is that the adjustments 
 can actually be inspected as they will be marked with a different colour.</p>
<p>Alternatively the weave adjustments can be made when the file is exported.</p>
<p>For more information - see the topic <a href="Weave_Adjustments.htm">Weave 
 Adjustments</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save the Design</span></p>
<p>Make sure that you save the design after weaves have been applied and 
 adjustments have been made.</p>
<p>This will ensure that if the file needs to be exported again at a later 
 time, the weaves and adjustments will already be incorporated.</p>
<p>You should save the Jacquard version of the design as a different file 
 name to that saved from Carpet Designer if there is one since the Jacquard 
 program saves different information and does not display nor save a frame 
 plan if one is attached to the file.</p>
<p>It is therefore recommended that you attach the word &quot;_Weave&quot; 
 to the filename or just a letter W or J for example so that the file names 
 can be distinguished. See the example below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="JaqSaveAs_001.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; 
									 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; 
									 margin-right: 0px;" width="615" height="360" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 9.0pt;">An 
 example of a directory holding two versions of one design SCP757_2.PRJ 
 and SCP757_2_Weave.PRJ</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Export File</span></p>
<p>Simply select menu option File -&gt; Export -&gt; BIN File or -&gt;Van 
 De Wiele File and proceed as described in the topic <a href="DesignerExport.chm::/Export_-_Introduction.htm">Export</a> 
 where the procedure is described in detail. However, the following applies 
 to the use of Export through the Jacquard program.</p>
<p>Once you have selected a Card Format from the drop down list in the 
 File Export dialog, the software can check that all the mathematics are 
 correct.</p>
<p>The message box shown here will be shown if the weave is not the correct 
 size for the design. For example, if you had applied weaves for a 3 frame 
 loom but accidentally selected a 5 frame format in the Export Dialog rather 
 than the 3 frame. Or, conversely, that you had used the wrong multipliers 
 when weaves were applied.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ExportApplyWeave6.gif" alt="" 
									 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; 
									 margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" 
									 width="395" height="126" border="0" /></p>
<p>The above message cannot occur when using Carpet Designer as the correct 
 multiplier for the Card Format is automatically used.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating a New Weave</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">More information about the pop-up 
 menu and about create new weave is given in the topic</span> <a href="Weave_Edit.htm"><span 
	 style="font-style: italic;">Weave Edit</span></a><span style="font-style: italic;">. 
 The following has been written with particular reference to carpet and 
 pile fabric designers.</span></p>
<p>If the weave you wish to use does not exist in the weaves directory, 
 you will have to design it from scratch so, to design a new weave:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="p"><p>Right Click on the colour in the Apply Weaves Dialog. 
	 This will cause the Pop-up menu to be displayed. (You can also right 
	 click on the weave itself on the left of the dialog).</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ExportApplyWeave7.gif" alt="" 
									 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; 
									 margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" 
									 width="463" height="274" border="0" /></p>
<ol start="2">
	<li class="p"><p>Select New. The &quot;Create Weave&quot; dialog will 
	 be displayed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ExportApplyWeave8.gif" alt="" 
									 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; 
									 margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" 
									 width="255" height="157" border="0" /></p>
<ol start="3">
	<li class="p"><p>Set the size of the weave required. For example if 
	 there are 3 frames and 2 control points per frame and 2 picks per 
	 design row then a normal weave (1 dent wide) will have width 6 and 
	 length 2.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Click on OK.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>The weave will be created to the required size with 
	 all grid positions empty.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Click in the weave where you require a mark. To remove 
	 a mark simply click it a second time with the left button. (The right 
	 button operates the Pop-up menu so does not insert a drop).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving a Weave</span></p>
<p>Right Click on the colour in the Apply Weaves Dialog. This will cause 
 the Pop-up menu to be displayed. (You can also right click on the weave 
 itself on the left of the dialog).</p>
<p>Select &quot;Save As…&quot; The &quot;Save As&quot; dialog will be displayed.</p>
<p>You can navigate to another location or create a new directory if you 
 wish and give the weave a name in the usual way. You should leave the 
 file type as IFF. Click on SAVE.</p>
<p>The weave will be saved and the SAVE dialog closed.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not absolutely essential to save the weave but if you 
 do not save it you will obviously have to redraw it the next time it is 
 required.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the weaves for the various different looms are 
 kept in separate directories as the list of weaves may eventually become 
 quite complex. Some types of cloth may also warrant their own directory 
 of weaves. For example, for a 3 frame Van de Wiele loom it will be worth 
 having 3 directories &quot;VDW 3frame&quot;, &quot;VDW 3frame SW&quot; 
 and &quot;VDW 3frame TW&quot;. Each of these may have a number of normal 
 and special effects weaves.</p>
