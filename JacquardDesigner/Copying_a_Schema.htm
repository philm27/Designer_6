<h1>Copying a Schema</h1>
<p>The features described here can save a lot of time in setting up new 
 designs that are similar to previous ones.</p>
<p>Once an Apply Weaves dialog has been opened it can be left open as long 
 as the project is open and schema details can be copied or dragged from 
 one Schema to another.</p>
<p>There are two ways that details can be copied from one schema to another...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Using Drag and Drop</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Using Copy and Paste*</p>
<p>* Note that Cut (&lt;ctrl&gt;+X) is also available but will clear the 
 weave names.</p>
<p>To use these features, load the two designs and open both Apply Weaves 
 Dialogs - you can copy from Simple Weaves to Composite and vice versa 
 but normally both dialogs will be the same type. When using these features 
 you may find it useful to stretch the target dialog to its maximum height.</p>
<p>In all cases it is the weave details that are copied. This includes 
 the weave file path, any edits, and shift, flip and invert flags. Color, 
 and selector information is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> 
 copied.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ApplyWeavesSimple_010.png" alt="" 
									 style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">An example showing a 
 block of 4 weaves being dragged from the left hand schema to the one on 
 the right.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Drag and Drop</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Simply select the weaves you wish to copy. 
 Hold the control key on the keyboard in order to multi-select. You can 
 also select one item then hold the shift key whilst selecting another 
 in order to select a range. The items do not have to be consecutive though 
 they normally will be.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Press and hold the left mouse button over 
 any of the selected items and drag to the target schema.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">The same number of target lines will be highlighted 
 and you should drop on the first target line that is to be set.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">When the mouse button is released, the weave 
 details will be copied to the target schema starting at the line at which 
 the cursor is pointing. Note that colors are ignored and it is not possible 
 to drop in the same window as the source.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Copy and Paste</p>
<p>Select the weaves you wish to copy. This is the same as for Drag and 
 Drop as described above so use the &lt;ctrl&gt; key and &lt;shift&gt; 
 key to multi-select if necessary. Again, the items do not have to be consecutive 
 though they normally will be.</p>
<p>Press &lt;ctrl&gt;+C on the keyboard to copy those items.</p>
<p>Click on the line in the target schema corresponding to the first line 
 of the copied items and press &lt;ctrl&gt;+V on the keyboard.</p>
<p>The weave details will be copied to the target schema. </p>
<p>It is also possible to Copy and Paste within the same Schema. As for 
 Drag and Drop it is only the weave name, and modifications that are copied</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">You may find Copy and Paste easier than 
 using drag and drop as it is easier to control the target.</p>
