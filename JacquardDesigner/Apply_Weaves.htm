<h1>Apply Weaves</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can apply weaves in one of two ways.</p>
<p>Note that if the cloth is a single cloth, there is no difference between 
 the two methods.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Apply_Weaves_Simple.htm">Simple 
 Weaves</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This method is so called because 
 you can regard each layer of the cloth as a separate cloth and apply basic 
 weaves such as plain, twill etc. to each layer.</span></p>
<p>This method uses the concept of a &quot;Schema&quot; (see below) and 
 is particularly useful for cloths that feature weft figuring or indeed 
 warp figuring since the software can also generate the complex threading 
 plan that might be involved.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Apply_Weaves_Composite.htm">Composite 
 Weaves</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This method requires the cloth to 
 be regarded essentially as a single cloth. If the cloth is in fact, a 
 multi-level cloth, then you must design and create all the required weaves. 
 In this case the weaves must be a composite of all the cloth levels.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Schema</p>
<p>The Schema defines for each artwork color:</p>
<p>The number of &quot;levels&quot;</p>
<p>The warp/weft pairings</p>
<p>The weaves for each level</p>
<p>The stitching points if any</p>
