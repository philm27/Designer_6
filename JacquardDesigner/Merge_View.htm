<h1>Merge View</h1>
<p>A view option in the Weave Editor that allows all the threads in an 
 artwork row to be shown on the same row in the view. Also, the user can 
 be selective about which colors (or levels) are actually shown at any 
 one time. The aspect ratio will thus be approximately correct for the 
 artwork. If two or more colors are lifted or dropped at the same time, 
 the colors are merged.</p>
<p>At present this is only available for designs that use weft figuring 
 or are 1:2 or 1:3 warp to weft ratio.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal; 
															 font-style: normal;">You 
 can switch between Normal View and Merge View using the additional tool 
 bar at the bottom of the information panel as shown here.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">An example of the Information 
 Panel whilst using Merge View. The Selectors Tool bar allows the user 
 to switch to or from Normal Mode and Merge Mode and also allows Selectors 
 to be switched on or off . In this example the user is in Merge Mode and 
 selectors 3 and 4 (the right hand two color buttons) are selected and 
 displayed.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Merge_001.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Example of a small section 
 of Merge View. Artwork rows 1-3 consist of a single level, rows 4-8 have 
 2 levels and rows 9-10 have 3 levels. Three different colors are shown 
 in the face. The bottom left being the background blue with a motif in 
 grey and beige at the top right. In this case the grey and beige are always 
 crammed (shown by the + sign). The colored squares in the weft bar represent 
 the weft threading plan with the first of each group of picks being on 
 the left. The pick number on the right of the weft bar is the first of 
 those picks (for example row 10 has 3 picks 17-19)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><img src="Merge_004.png" 
														 alt="" style="border: none;" 
														 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">In this example the 
 grey and beige have been switched off using the buttons at the bottom 
 of the information panel. A cross is drawn through these colors in the 
 weft bar on the left. The weave itself shows only the blue in selector 
 1. Even though the grey and beige are not shown in the weave, the cramming 
 mark can still be edited in the usual way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Merge_002.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The same section of 
 the design showing the artwork only.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">You can edit the colors 
 and cramming in the normal way. Obviously this will automatically be reflected 
 in the threading plan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">Note, however, &#160;that 
 you cannot display nor modify the <a href="Weft_Controls.htm">weft controls</a> 
 A-Z whilst using Merge View.</p>
