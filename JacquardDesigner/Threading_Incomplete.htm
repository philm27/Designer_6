<h1>Threading Incomplete</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Loading a design having incomplete threading</p>
<p>The software is quite tolerant of incomplete threading sequences. If 
 the threading exists but is too short for the weave, it will be made up 
 to the correct length providing it is a simple repeat pattern such as 
 an AB sequence or a solid colour.</p>
<p>This prevents warning messages in many cases.</p>
<p>However, if a complex threading sequence is present, which is too short, 
 then a warning message will be displayed if you attempt to display the 
 cloth view.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Designs Threading</span></p>
<p>The software will initially default to colour 1 is warp selector 1 colour 
 2 is weft selector 1.</p>
<p>For a single cloth the threading will automatically be set to solid 
 colour.</p>
<p>For a double cloth the threading will automatically be set to an AB 
 threading.</p>
<p>For a treble cloth it will be set to an ABC threading etc..</p>
<p>The above default threading sequences are set at the moment that weaves 
 are applied providing there is no existing threading sequence as would 
 be the case with a new design.</p>
