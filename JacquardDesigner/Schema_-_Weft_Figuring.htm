<h1>Schema - Weft Figuring</h1>
<p>Schemas are created, reset and edited using the &quot;<a href="Apply_Weaves_Simple.htm">Apply 
 Weaves Simple</a>&quot; dialog.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Schema2.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt; text-align: center;">In this 
 example, the face weave for black and green areas is sati5 and in other 
 cases satiback10 is used. Sati5 will be a weft faced weave and satiback10 
 will be a warp faced weave. The pink areas in the design use the pink 
 selector in the face and this is to be weave sati8 with satiback32 for 
 any other selectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a cloth having weft cramming or warp extras 
 there are a variable number of levels for each artwork color as in the 
 following Cramming example:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When creating these schemas, the selector 
 color is shown since it is known from the <a href="Selectors.htm">Selector 
 Dialog</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this case the sequence of the levels does 
 not matter since the appearance in the face is dependant only on the weaves 
 used. Thus it is up to he user to use the correct face and back weaves.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">*The asterisks in the above schema indicate 
 a &quot;main&quot; entry for the color i.e. in the case of line 4 above, 
 selector 4 will work on every pick in which the black artwork color occurs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additional &quot;main&quot; entries can be 
 added to any color in those circumstances where an additional selector 
 needs to work in every occurrence of an artwork color e.g. underneath 
 a weft stripe. See the topic <a href="Add_Schema_Entry.htm">Add Schema 
 Entry</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When creating a schema where Cramming or Extras 
 are used, the software checks to see how many selector colors cross each 
 motif in the design. Thus we can see in the example above that pink and 
 black selector colors cross the green motifs in the design. Since it is 
 an example of a cloth using Weft Cramming, there must be a black motif 
 to the left and/or right of the green motif. This does not mean to say 
 that there will always be 3 levels where green occurs but rather that 
 there is a maximum of 3 levels where green occurs.</p>
