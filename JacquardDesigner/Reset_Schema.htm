<h1>Reset Schema</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This dialog is displayed when you select the &quot;Reset Schema&quot; 
 button on the &quot;Apply Simple Weaves&quot; dialog.</p>
<p>You will be prompted to &quot;Reset the Schema&quot; when selecting 
 the &quot;Apply Simple Weaves&quot; dialog if you have made a change to 
 the design necessitating a schema change. You should use this option when 
 you change the design by adding more colours and in the case of Cramming 
 and Extras, even if part of the design has simply been re-drawn since 
 it may mean that you need to specify more weaves.</p>
<p>Note that using this option does not lose any required weave information 
 as all weaves will be copied to the new schema at the appropriate level 
 or warp/weft selector. The only weave information that will be lost is 
 that for unused Artwork colours or levels.</p>
<p>Any new colours or levels/selectors will be set to &quot;No Weave&quot;.</p>
<p>The dialog looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ResetSchema1C.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; 
									 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; 
									 margin-right: 0px;" width="285" height="227" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 9.0pt;">Example 
 &quot;Schema Reset&quot; dialog set for Weft Cramming.</span></p>
<p>The following rules apply at present:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>You can set either Extra Ends or Crammed Picks but 
	 not both.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>If you set either Extra Ends or Crammed Picks then 
	 Full Levels must both be 1 i.e. a single cloth.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Full Levels must be in the range 1 to 3.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>If Warp and Weft Full Levels are different then one 
	 of them must be 1, you cannot have a cloth that is a 2:3 ratio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Simply select the appropriate options 
 and set the number of warp and weft full levels then select OK.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Levels</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is used to indicate a level 
 which runs the full width or length of the cloth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">In a double cloth, there may for 
 example be 160 ends in the face repeat and 160 ends in the back repeat 
 making 320 ends in total. Both levels are full in this case as there are 
 always 2 ends for each &quot;artwork&quot; end, or, to put it another 
 way, 1 artwork end converts to 2 cloth ends, 1 for each level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If, there are 160 face ends but only 
 200 ends in total with an occasional second level (or more) being used 
 according to the design then that requires use of Warp Extras and those 
 levels are not &quot;Full&quot; Levels.</span></p>
