<h1>Add Schema Entry</h1>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;"><img 
	 src="AddSchema_001.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">Example 
 design to be produced by weft cramming containing full width stripes.</span></p>
<p>When the schema is created for a design such as this one, it will simply 
 use 3 selectors and will effectively be a simple single cloth as only 
 one selector will work where the stripes occur as shown in the first illustration 
 below.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, the designer may wish to make the white yarn 
 continue to work underneath the two stripes so that white works on every 
 design row.</p>
<p>The new feature allows that to be easily achieved.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="AddSchema_002.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">Example 
 of a simple schema for a design having 2 horizontal stripes note the asterisks 
 indicating the &quot;main&quot; selector for that color in a crammed fabric.</span></p>
<p>In order to add an entry simply select the position at which the entry 
 is to be added and display the pop-up menu by pressing the right hand 
 button as shown in the illustration above. Select Edit-&gt;Add Entry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="AddSchema_004.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">The 
 &quot;Add Schema Entry&quot; dialog.</span></p>
<p>The &quot;Add Schema Entry&quot; dialog will be shown allowing a selector 
 to be chosen. The dialog also shows the artwork color to which it will 
 be assigned. The selector can be either a completely new one (not used 
 anywhere else) or it can be a selector already used elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, it does not make sense to add another entry for the main selector 
 for a palette color (which is already working on every pick that the color 
 occupies). For this reason not every selector will be listed in the drop 
 down list.</p>
<p>To proceed simply choose the required selector from the drop down list 
 (it does not need to have a color selected in the Selectors dialog at 
 this stage) and click on OK. In the example here we choose 1 as we want 
 white to work at the same time as the other two colors where the stripes 
 occur.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="AddSchema_005.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">This 
 is only shown if the chosen selector does not have a color allocated to 
 it. In this case color 5 has already been chosen as the color for selector 
 4.</span></p>
<p>If the selector does not currently have a color allocated to it the 
 &quot;Choose Selector Color&quot; dialog will be displayed showing the 
 palette. Simply choose a color from the palette and click on OK to proceed.</p>
<p>It is not possible to select a color which is already used.</p>
<p>The software will automatically add the new selector to other artwork 
 colors in the schema, if necessary, in situations where it will now pass 
 across other colours.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="AddSchema_006.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">Example 
 of a striped fabric to be produced using weft cramming, with selector 
 1 made to work where the orange and blue horizontal stripes occur. Note 
 also the &quot;++&quot; beside entries which work on every pick.</span></p>
<p>The schema is now ready for weaves to be applied.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">A more complex Example</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; text-align: center;"><img src="AddSchema_007.png" 
														 alt="" style="border: none;" 
														 border="0" /></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt; text-align: center;">A 
 more complicated example in which selector 5 works on each pick where 
 the red palette color occurs, shown by the &quot;++&quot; marker. It also 
 occurs in two other colors in this image (where the &quot;+&quot; marker 
 is shown. In those cases the entry is present only as a place to specify 
 the weave to be used when selector 5 crosses that color area.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;"><a name="Removing_an_Additional_Entry"></a>Removing 
 an Additional Entry</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; ">To 
 remove a Schema Entry added in this way, simply select menu option Edit-&gt;Remove 
 Entry. The software will show a list of the item or items to be removed 
 which can then be confirmed. Because of the complexity of overlapping 
 motifs, all occurrences of that selector as an &quot;Additional Entry&quot; 
 will be removed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; ">Note 
 that Any Addition or removal of Schema entries can be undone/redone.</p>
