<h1>Apply Weaves Selective</h1>
<p>You can restrict the application of weaves to one color or even to individual 
 levels in the overall weave. This feature can be used in the Simple Weaves 
 dialog or in the Composite Weaves dialog.</p>
<p>To do this use the pop-up menu option as illustrated here, or click 
 on the button in the toolbar.</p>
<p>After a selective apply weave, the dialog will remain open so that it 
 is easy to repeat the process after making new selections and/or changing 
 weaves.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">An example of the Apply 
 weaves dialog. User has selected 4 items for color 10 and is about to 
 apply those weaves without affecting any other area in the overall weave. 
 The user could have selected only one or two of those selectors in this 
 case as it is a crammed fabric (see restrictions below).</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Restrictions</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">When using &quot;Apply 
 Weaves Simple&quot; for a Double Cloth, Treble Cloth or any other structure 
 that has more than one level in warp <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> 
 weft, then the user must select all schema entries for a color, this is 
 because the software is inserting lifters and possibly stitching points 
 &#160;that affect multiple levels of the cloth.</p>
