<h1><b>Lock to Size </b></h1>
<p>This facility is provided for printed carpet. </p>
<p>If you want the textured carpet to be displayed at a different quality 
 to the design quality, use this option. For example, you may have designed 
 your carpet on 28 x 28, but want it to appear to be on a woven quality 
 of 7 x 7. </p>
<p>The textured bitmap files represent 20 tufts in the width and length. 
 You can specify what size in area the bitmap file should represent. If 
 you want to display the texture at 10 tufts to the inch in width and height, 
 set the UNITS to Inches and the WIDTH and LENGTH to 2 x 2. </p>
<p>This facility will not affect the scale of your design. The texture 
 is simply overlaid on top of the design. </p>
