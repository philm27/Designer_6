<h1>&#160;Draw Grid from Left</h1>
<p>Check this box to draw the grid from the left. This option does not generally matter unless the bold line frequecy does not fit into the design repeat width a whole number of times.</p>
<p>For instance if bold lines were being drawn every 8 ends and the design was 100 ends wide then the 4 end remainder will normally be on the right. However, if this option is unchecked it would appear on the left.</p>
