<h1>Textile Desktop Publisher Help</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Help Files! They have been written to help you, the designer, 
 get the most out of APSO Textile Desktop Publishing package. They are 
 intended for use by both new and experienced customers as there may well 
 be facilities that even the most experienced APSO users have never had 
 a chance to explore.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Everything 
 is explained in easy stages and in everyday language. The Desktop Publishing 
 software has been designed to be user-friendly - you do not need to be 
 a computer wizard to use it!</span></font></p>
