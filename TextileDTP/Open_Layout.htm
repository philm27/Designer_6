<h1>Open Layout</h1>
<p>Open a layout as an additional document in the current project. If the 
 chosen layout is part of the current project (based on its file name), 
 the file name will be used as the document name. However if the file is 
 part of a different project it will be renamed as part of the current 
 project using the next free file name.</p>
