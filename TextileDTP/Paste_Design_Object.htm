<h1>Copy and Paste Design Objects</h1>
<p>You can copy and paste using standard keyboard shortcuts <?rh-ignored 
	 text="Ctrl+C" ?>Ctrl+C and <?rh-ignored text="Ctrl+V" ?>Ctrl+V. Both 
 Designs and Palette objects can be copied (as well as Text objects)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note that when copying a palette all details 
 are copied so a copied palette will still be associated with the same 
 design object.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">You can also copy images from a separate 
 software product, the resulting design or logo object will be treated 
 as an imported <?rh-ignored text="bitmap" ?>bitmap image.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">To Copy a Design Object</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Simply select it and type <?rh-ignored text="Ctrl+C" ?>Ctrl+C on the 
 keyboard or select Copy on the Edit menu.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">To Paste a Design Object</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(1) Type <?rh-ignored text="Ctrl+V" ?>Ctrl+V on the keyboard.</p>
<p>(2) Select Paste-&gt;Design on the pop-up menu</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Pasting from an external software source</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The software will offer a choice of &quot;Paste as Design&quot; or &quot;Paste 
 as Logo&quot; if the object is from an external source. If pasted as a 
 design, the software will treat the image as an imported <?rh-ignored 
	 text="bitmap" ?>bitmap image since it does not know it's source or 
 file location.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Saving a Layout Containing a Pasted Image</p>
<p>If a layout is saved that contains images from an external source, the 
 software will not simply be able to save the location of the file as is 
 normally the case. .There are two ways to counteract this.</p>
<p>(1) You can save the image to a file after it has been placed in the 
 layout. To do this, right click the object in the layout and select Save 
 on the Pop-up menu. You can then save the image in any location as any 
 standard file type. The software will remember this location in the .<?rh-ignored 
	 text="lyt" ?>lyt file if it is subsequently saved.</p>
<p>(2) When saving the layout, the software will detect a pasted image 
 and will offer the chance to embed the image (or images) in the layout 
 file.</p>
