<h1>Warp/Weft Blocks in Jacquard</h1>
<p>When using Jacquard Designer, this page of the Palette Properties is 
 slightly different. It includes a check box &quot;Block as Warp and Weft&quot;.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">.<img src="PaletteProps_005.png" alt="" 
									 style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">An 
 example in which &quot;Block as Warp and Weft&quot; has been selected. 
 In this case the normal Palette Blocks option is disabled except for the 
 Gap between rows.</span> </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Block as Warp and Weft</p>
<p>When this is selected the software will automatically block the warp 
 and weft colors (according to the Selectors dialog and the threading dialog 
 in the main program) as two rows showing a row (or column) of warp colors 
 and a row (or column) of weft colors. Each is shown in selector order 
 which may in some cases result in a palette color being shown twice if 
 it appears in both warp and weft.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All other aspects of this dialog are as described in the topic <a href="Palette_Blocks.htm">Palette 
 Blocks</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Note also that when using Jacquard Designer, it is possible to add Selector 
 Number to the swatch text - see the topic <a href="Palette_Swatch_Text.htm">Palette 
 Swatch Text</a></p>
