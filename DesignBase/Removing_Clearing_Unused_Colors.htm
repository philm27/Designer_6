<h1>Removing/Clearing Unused Colors</h1>
<p>You can easily Remove unused colors or Clear them using the two menu 
 options on the Palette Menu:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">Remove Unused Colors</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Select this to quickly remove from the 
 palette all unused colors. Note that the software will check the shelf 
 and the current brush and will also check the Frame Plan in Carpet Designer 
 and the threading sequence in Jacquard Designer and will report if there 
 are colors that cannot be removed because they are used in those areas.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">Clear Unused Colors</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">This is very similar but will clear all 
 unused colors to black which is useful if you wish to keep the same palette 
 numbers. Again, the software will check the shelf and the current brush 
 and will also check the Frame Plan in Carpet Designer and the threading 
 sequence in Jacquard Designer and will report if there are colors that 
 cannot be removed because they are used in those areas.</p>
