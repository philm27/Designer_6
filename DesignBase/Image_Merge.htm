<h1>Image Merge</h1>
<p>This function allows the design to blend two different designs by blending 
 a separate design (the overlay) into the current design. The overlay can 
 come from the shelf or from a separate design chosen from disk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Palette</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The two designs do not need to have the 
 same palette and after this operation the palette will in most cases be 
 much larger due to the combination of the color values, If the palette 
 size exceeds 255, the user will be warned and offered the opportunity 
 to reduce the colors to 255 or less.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">At present it is not possible to display 
 an image having more than 255 colors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Color Blend</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The software can do either a color blend 
 (using the weight chosen) or can just be used to darken or lighten the 
 current design. In the latter case, the Overlay is effectively converted 
 to a grey image before being blended.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Repeat And Placement</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The Overlay can be placed at any location 
 over the current design and can also be repeated out. When being repeated, 
 the repeat of the overlay is taken into account so it could be a normal 
 repeat with a drop or a brick repeat or could be Horizontal or Vertical 
 only.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Weight</p>
<p>The Overlay can be applied with a very subtle effect or with a strong 
 effect.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Size/Quality</p>
<p>The two designs do not need to be the same quality. The overlay can 
 be re-sized and/or stretched in either axis and can easily be stretched 
 to fit the current design.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ImageMerge_001.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">Example 
 of the Image Merge dialog with 2 repeats of the current design selected 
 and the Overlay as &quot;Stretch to Fit&quot; which is why the black outline 
 is marking one repeat of the current design. Also selected is 25% weight 
 and this is a &quot;grey&quot; blend.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Editing 
 the Size and Location of the Overlay</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">Providing 
 you have not selected &quot;Stretch to Fit&quot;, you can re-size the 
 Overlay by dragging the handles of the black selection rectangle in any 
 direction. If you have selected &quot;Keep Aspect&quot; the rectangle 
 will automatically adjust to the same exact shape as the original Overlay 
 design. To move the selection rectangle click within the rectangle and 
 drag to another location, but note this is only possible if &quot;Locate 
 as Specified&quot; is selected.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Stretch 
 to Fit</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Select this to cause the 
 Overlay to be made the same size as &#160;the current design. When selected 
 it will not be possible to edit the size or location of the Overlay, nor 
 will it be possible to select Repeat Out or Keep Aspect. </p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Centre</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Select this to cause the 
 Overlay to be centered within the Current Design. It will not be possible 
 to edit the location of the Overlay when this is selected, though it can 
 be re-sized normally and can be repeated out if required.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Locate 
 as Specified</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">This option gives the user 
 complete freedom to move the Overlay to any location over the current 
 design.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Repeat 
 Out</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Select this to cause the 
 software to repeat the Overlay across the entire design. When doing this 
 the repeat of the overlay will be taken into account. Also note that a 
 Vertical repeat will only be repeated vertically and similarly a Horizontal 
 repeat will only be repeated horizontally.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Keep 
 Aspect</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Select this to cause the 
 Overlay to be kept in its correct shape though it may be re-sized.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Color 
 Blend</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Select this to create a 
 color blend in which the resulting colors are a blend of the two colors 
 at any one pixel where the Overlay overlaps the main design. If this is 
 not checked then only the strength of the overlay color is used to adjust 
 the brightness of the main design.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Position 
 Size and Units</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">You can modify the location 
 of the overlay (unless Stretch to Fit) is selected by modifying these 
 fields in the usual way. You can use any of the usual units i.e. pixels, 
 inches, cm etc. but note that the location in this case is measured from 
 the top left of the design. if you modify the size or location by dragging 
 the location rectangle over the image preview, these figures will be modified 
 automatically.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Weight</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Type in a weight percentage 
 or use the slider control to modify the weight used when blending the 
 two images. Zero% would give no weight at all to the Overlay colors thus 
 would not change anything. 100% would completely replace the design colors 
 with the overlay colors.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Overlay 
 File Path</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">This shows the overlay file 
 path which will be remembered from the previous use of the Merge feature. 
 You can type a new path or use the Browse button in the usual way.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Browse</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Click on the Browse button 
 to display an Open File dialog which you can use in the usual way to find 
 the required file.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; ">Shelf...</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">Use this to select a shelf 
 item to merge with the current main design.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">1, 2, 
 3 Repeats</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt;">This purely for reference 
 allowing the user to see additional repeats - it does not make any difference 
 to the result.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold;">Reset</p>
<p>This will reset the overlay size to its correct size and aspect.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Undo</p>
<p>Click on this to undo any previous operation - not just the Image Merge 
 operation. Note that an image merge operation usually causes a palette 
 change as well as a design change, this will cause both to be undone. 
 If you have closed this dialog and then do a normal undo it will only 
 undo the design change, the palette undo will have to be done as well 
 to get back to the exact previous state.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Merge</p>
<p>Click on this to cause the Merge to be performed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Close</p>
<p>Click on this to simply close the dialog.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Example</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;"><img 
	 src="ImageMerge_002.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">Possible 
 result of above Image Blend</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;"><img 
	 src="ImageMerge_003.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">A similar 
 merge operation but this time using a color blend and repeating the operation 
 over the entire design with a weight of 40%</p>
