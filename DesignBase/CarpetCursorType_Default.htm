<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Cursor Preferences</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Select a cursor-type default by going to preferences (edit-&gt;preferences). 
 You should select the Cursor tab this is normally displayed first by default.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Prefs_Cursor.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; 
									 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; 
									 margin-right: 0px;" width="321" height="408" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mouse Wheel</span></p>
<p>You can control &#160;the speed that he mouse wheel affects the zoom 
 function my modifying this value. It will initially default to 1. It is 
 recommended that you only use values of 1 2 or 3. this value represents 
 the number of steps that the program will zoom in or out by for each &quot;notch&quot; 
 on the wheel. The maximum value is set to 5.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cross Hair</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If checked then a cross hair will 
 be displayed whilst using free hand draw and line draw.</span> If the 
 cross hair is on, it is visible on top of the brush. If it is de-selected, 
 you just see the brush.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock in Centre of Tuft</span></p>
<p>This option will cause a cross hair (if being used) to be always displayed 
 in the centre of the grid point (or tuft for carpet users). When the mouse 
 or pen is moved to another grid point, the cross hair will jump to the 
 centre of that grid point. If the lock is de-selected, the cross hair 
 will move smoothly to any pixel on the display.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cursor Style</span></p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>Normal - the brush is seen as a block of colour (size 
	 as selected).</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Outline - the brush is seen as a block of colour with 
	 a fine outline (size as selected).</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Transparent - only the outline of the brush can be 
	 seen until it is placed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above only apply to the standard brushes available in the control 
 panel. A custom brush never has an oultline.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This option can be used with or without 
 the cross hair option and the Lock in Centre option above.</span></p>
<p>Experiment with different cursor types to find what suits your working 
 method best. Once you have selected your default, it will remain that 
 way until you alter it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cross Hair Style</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">You can select a cross hair from 
 the list shown. Scroll the list to see other options and select the one 
 you would like to use. The selected cross hair will be marked with a check 
 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Dark Medium Light options are 
 simply so that you can view the chosen cross hair against different background 
 colours. These settings do not in any way have a permanent effect on the 
 cursor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Some cross hairs are more solid than 
 others and may be easier to see.</span></p>
