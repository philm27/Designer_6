<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The frequency of bold lines in the grid is set in the <a href="Specification_Dialog.htm">specification</a> 
 dialog Â– you will find a section of the window called &quot;Grid Information&quot;.</p>
<p>If you require bold lines at intervals which correspond to the ends 
 and rows (picks) per inch (or cm etc) simply select the &quot;Grid as 
 Quality&quot; option.</p>
<p>For example, if your design quality is 7 x 7 to the inch, then you will 
 probably require bold grid lines every 7 ends and 7 rows. If this is the 
 case just select the &quot;Grid as Quality&quot; option in the specification 
 dialog.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you would like bold lines to occur independently 
 of the quality (or &quot;setting&quot;), simply make sure that &quot;Grid 
 as Quality&quot; is not selected and enter the bold line interval for 
 both ends and rows (picks). For example, if you are working on a design 
 quality of 7 x 8.33, you may want bold grid lines every 7 ends but every 
 25 rows (3 inches) in the vertical axis. In this case, you would set the 
 grid setting to width 7 length 25.</p>
<p>Alternatively, fabric designers may be using a setting of, say, 48 to 
 the inch by 36 to the inch but may wish to have a bold grid line every 
 8 ends and picks. In this case simply set each of these two fields to 
 8 as described above.</p>
