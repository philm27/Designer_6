<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Changing Size using Specification</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Design size can be increased or decreased through the <a href="Specification_Dialog.htm">specification 
 dialog</a>. Once you have entered your new design size (in ends and rows 
 or in design measurements) and clicked on OK to accept the alterations, 
 a dimension window will appear on screen. This window allows you to select 
 which edge of your design you want to add to or cut from. For example, 
 if you have increased your design size in the vertical axis, you can choose 
 to add the extra rows all to the top, all to the bottom, or to split them 
 equally adding half to the top and half to the bottom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="DimensionDlg.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; 
									 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; 
									 margin-right: 0px;" width="146" height="288" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Designs with Borders</span></p>
<p>This feature can be used to advantage in order to create the basic layout 
 of a rug or any fabric having a border as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="p"><p>Start a new design and set the size innitially to 
	 the size of the centre panel of the rug. Click on OK when the above 
	 panel appears. You should now have a design in a solid colour (the 
	 current background colour) representing the centre panel of the rug.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Change your background palette colour.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Access the specification window again.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Increase your design size to the full rug size. Click 
	 on OK.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>In the dimension window make sure that &quot;Add to 
	 Both&quot; is selected for width and height. Click on OK. This will 
	 add the additional width to both sides equally and similarly for the 
	 length. The additional area, the border of the rug, will use the new 
	 right hand button colour</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This method could in fact be applied several times to build up a series 
 of inner and outer borders of different widths. Just change the background 
 palette colour for every new area you add.</p>
<p>Also, the borders could be added at one side only, if required, by selection 
 of the appropriate option in the above dialog.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">You can immediately see your new design size, 
 both in ends/rows and in design measurements, displayed in the <a href="CarpetUnderstanding_the_Status_Bar.htm">status 
 bar</a> .</p>
