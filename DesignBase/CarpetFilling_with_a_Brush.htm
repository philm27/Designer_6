<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Filling with a Brush</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is possible to fill an enclosed area with a <a href="CarpetCustom_Brushes.htm">custom 
 brush</a>.</p>
<p>To fill with a brush, follow the same procedure as for <a href="CarpetFilling_with_a_Single_Colour.htm">filling 
 with a single colour</a> Â– just pick up your brush before clicking on 
 the area to fill.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Brush Location</span></p>
<p>The system uses the current <a href="CarpetThe_Importance_of_Brush_Handles.htm">Brush 
 Handle</a> to locate the brush as a repeating pattern in the area to be 
 filled. It will do this even if the shape is the exact shape of the brush 
 or is smaller than it. There is thus always a chance that the edges of 
 the repeating pattern (i.e. the brush) will appear in the filled area.</p>
<p>The brush fills outwards from the point designated by the handle type. 
 For instance, if you have selected a top left handle, the brush will fill 
 across and down from the top left-hand corner of your design. If the brush 
 handle is the centre of the brush then that centre is fixed in the centre 
 of the design and is repeated outwards to fill the design area.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you are filling an area within your design, 
 rather than the whole area of your design, the brush still fills invisibly 
 from the corners or centre of your design (it does not fill from the corners 
 or centre of the area to be filled).</p>
