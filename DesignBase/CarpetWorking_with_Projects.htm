<p>A project consists of your main design and all its <a href="CarpetWorking_with_Shelves.htm">shelf</a> 
 items and all its print layouts.</p>
<p>The project is held in a .prj file which holds the main design and all 
 its shelf items. The print layouts are file type .lyt and will be named 
 for example project1_1.lyt, project1_2.lyt etc for a project file having 
 a name project1.prj. The lyt files do not need to end with a number but 
 they must start with the project name and the &quot;_&quot; (underscore) 
 character.</p>
<p>There can be any number of projects loaded simultaneously and each project 
 can have a maximum of 999 shelf items. This enables you to refer to other 
 designs and copy sections from them to your current design.</p>
<p>The shelf items share the palette and will normally have the same quality 
 as the main design which is in box 1 on the shelf.</p>
<p>When you initially start the software, the first &quot;New Design&quot; 
 will be project 1, the second project2 etc.</p>
<p>To copy brushes or shelf items to another project see the topic <a href="CarpetCarrying_Shelves_between_Project.htm">Copying 
 Brushes and Shelf Items between Projects</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting a New Project</span></p>
<p>Select menu item File -&gt; New Project. This will create a new design 
 with <a href="CarpetDesign_Size_Default.htm">default specifications</a> 
 , using the palette from the project that you are replacing.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear Project</span></p>
<p>To clear a project, select menu option File -&gt; Clear Project. You 
 can then either open an existing design or create a new one. In the latter 
 case, the new design will be created with your default specifications 
 and <a href="CarpetPalette_Default.htm">default colour palette.</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Projects</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you 
 save the project as file type PRJ then the shelf items will also be saved 
 in the same file with the main design -</span> see the topic <a href="CarpetSaving_Projects.htm">Saving 
 Projects</a>.</p>
