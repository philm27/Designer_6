<p><b>Aspect Correct</b></p>
<p>By selecting this button, your design will always be displayed at its 
 true aspect ratio i.e. the ends per inch and picks or rows per inch will 
 be taken into account.</p>
<p>It is advisable to work with this selected permanently so that you always 
 see the design as it will be seen in production. It is only necessary 
 to <?rh-ignored text="un-select" ?>un-select this option if you want to 
 work with each point shown as a square which will be very rare.</p>
