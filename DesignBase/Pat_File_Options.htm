<h1>Pat File Options</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When saving PAT files, under certain circumstances you may need to save 
 the file with a slightly different palette numbering arrangement. Carpet 
 Designer provides an option to save the file with what is known as a &quot;zero&quot; 
 colour. Basically this means that the palette numbering would start from 
 0, rather than 1. (e.g. 0,1,2,3,4 as opposed to 1,2,3,4,etc.).</p>
<p>In a PAT file colour zero is a 'null' colour representing areas in carpet 
 that are 'felling' or backing only for example in a circular rug the zero 
 colour would be used in the area outside the circle which is not part 
 of the rug.</p>
<p>For normal designs you should use the preference 'No Zero Colour' i.e. 
 the palette does not contain the zero colour. However, if you have made 
 your own zero colour in the palette however so that you can specify the 
 'dead' areas in the design you should select the alternative 'Save designs 
 using the first palette entry as the zero colour'. In these cases you 
 should use the first palette colour to indicate the 'dead' areas.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Zero Color</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">You should use this setting for normal 
 designs. It enables you to use all palette colors normally.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>Go to menu option Edit-&gt;Preferences</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Select the General tab</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Tick &quot;Save Designs with no Zero Color&quot;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To save a design with Zero Color</span></p>
<p>If you have used the first palette colour to indicate 'dead' areas in 
 the design</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>Repeat the first 2 steps above.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Select the option &quot;Save designs using the first 
	 palette entry as the zero colour&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Click OK to apply these changes and close the Preferences dialog.</p>
