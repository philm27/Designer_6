<h1>Undo Preferences - Advanced</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">Undo Preferences are displayed by selecting 
 menu option Edit-&gt;Undo Preferences. The Advanced Tab looks like this...</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">Compression</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">To use the compression 
 option, make sure the option is checked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">You also need to 
 consider how large an image should be compressed and this can be set to 
 zero to force all images in the history to be compressed or it may be 
 quite high, say, 8MB to force all images of 8MB and over to be compressed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">The value chosen 
 for the minimum size may depend, to some extent, on the speed of you processor. 
 You may see no difference to response times for a fast processor, but 
 if you are using a relatively slow PC you may see some small slowing down 
 for a large drawing operation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">This value can 
 be modified at any time so if you can always increase this value later 
 if you find that you would like faster responses. However, it is a complex 
 issue, and the fact that a compressed &quot;snapshot&quot; of the design 
 actually takes up less memory means that response from all the software 
 currently active could well be improved indirectly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">Archive</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">The archive option, 
 when activated, can be used to further reduce the amount of main memory 
 used while working. The software will write the undo history to disk files 
 in a nominated folder and will only bring them back into memory if they 
 are required for an undo or redo operation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">Undo Cache</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">This is the number 
 of history items that will initially be retained in memory before being 
 archived. It can be set to zero in order to immediately archive the history 
 item after a drawing operation, or it can be set to say 6 as in the example 
 above. This would cause the 6 most recent history items to be retained 
 in memory to make undo/redo as fast as possible over the last 6 steps.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">As for the compression 
 option above, this value can be modified at any time so if you can always 
 increase this value later if you find that you would like faster responses. 
 As indicated above, using this option, with as low a cache value as possible, 
 could indirectly improves response from all the software currently active.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">Undo Folder</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">This must specify 
 a folder on you PC and should ideally be a special folder created for 
 the purpose as it will eventually contain may work files created by the 
 software. There will be 1 file for each history item for each project 
 and for each copy of the software currently active.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">The software will 
 keep this folder tidy but old files will not be deleted until the software 
 is reloaded. Any problem files will be deleted after 28 days - these may 
 result after the software is terminated abnormally.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; 
									 font-size: 9.0pt;">To specify the 
 undo folder simply type the name in in the usual way. The software will 
 create the folder if it does not exist (it will also create parent folders 
 if they do not exist). You can also choose an existing folder by clicking 
 on the browse button.</span></p>
