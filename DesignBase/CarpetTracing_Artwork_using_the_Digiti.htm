 Digitizer</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you want to trace around a piece of artwork, or input painted archive 
 designs into the computer, you can fix your digitizer so that the software 
 knows the exact location of the artwork. This function is not relevant 
 if you are working with a mouse.</p>
<p>To set your digitizer to the drafting mode, follow these steps:-</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol>
	<li class="p"><p>Stick your artwork onto the digitizer, taking care 
	 to make sure it is level (i.e. that the bottom of your artwork is 
	 parallel to the bottom of the digitizer).</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Input your design-size details in the Specification 
	 window. (For example, if you are tracing around a small scale piece 
	 of artwork that you want to be drafted on to 252 ends x 252 rows, 
	 input 252 x 252 as your specification.)</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Select menu option File-&gt;Digitizer-&gt;Fix. Note 
	 that if you have not installed a driver for your digitizer this menu 
	 option will not be present.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>You will be prompted to place your pen on the bottom 
	 left, bottom right and top right-hand corners of your artwork  make 
	 sure that you do this accurately. If you make a mistake, go back to 
	 step 3 and try again.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>You will now be in Drafting mode until you select 
	 Drafting Off in the Digitizer sub-menu.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Whilst you are working in drafting mode the 
 pen will be trapped within the boundaries specified in step 3. To perform 
 a function outside this working area (i.e. select a <a href="CarpetSelecting_a_Foreground_Colour.htm">new 
 colour</a> , choose a new function from the <a href="CarpetUsing_the_Toolbox.htm">toolbox</a> 
 ) use the mouse. The new function/colour will then be active in the pen.</p>
