<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Using Undo/Redo</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Use the &quot;Undo&quot; feature to undo the last drawing operation. 
 If you make an alteration to your design that you are not happy with, 
 you can &quot;undo&quot; it, and get back to the stage you were at before 
 the alteration.</p>
<p>For more information see the topic <a href="Undo_Types.htm">Undo Types</a>.</p>
<p>Note that once you do another drawing operation (or something else that 
 needs to be written to the history), the new data will replace any history 
 that has been undone but not <span style="font-style: italic;">redone</span>, 
 though you <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> undo the new operation 
 and any previous ones still in the history..</p>
<p>For example if you do 7 drawing operations which we will number 1 to 
 7 for convenience. Then undo all 7 and redo operations 1 and 2 and start 
 drawing again, then drawing operations 3 to 7 will be permanently lost 
 and cannot be redone.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of Undos</span></p>
<p>The number of drawing operations that can be stored is limited but can 
 be set using preferences - see the topic <a href="Undo_Preferences.htm">Undo 
 Preferences</a>. The default is 20 but you can increase it to 100 or more 
 if you wish.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Undo Preferences</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: normal;">Undo has a set of preferences 
 - see the topic <a href="Undo_Preferences.htm">Undo Preferences</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undo in 
 Carpet Designer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Any frame plan edits and swap operations 
 can be undone in the usual way using &quot;Normal Undo&quot;.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Undo in Jacquard Designer</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">For Jacquard Designer users, the 
 weave can be modified and undone separately so if you edit floats in the 
 weave then return to the artwork you can undo artwork changes and if necessary 
 return to the weave and undo any previous weave changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The weave history is cleared when 
 weaves are applied.</span></p>
