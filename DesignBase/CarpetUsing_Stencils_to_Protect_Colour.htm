<title>Using Stencils to Protect Colours</title>

<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Stencil</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is possible to mask off colours within a design so that those areas 
 are protected. For example, you may want to apply an effect to the background 
 in a design (such as a spray). By applying a stencil to all colours except 
 the background colour, you can apply the spray at random, without having 
 to worry about the spray colour damaging the main motif.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="StencilPalette.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; 
									 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; 
									 margin-right: 0px;" width="346" height="105" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example 
 palette showing stencil buttons. Color 1 is unprotected. Other colors 
 are protected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create a Stencil</span></p>
<ol>
	<li class="p"><p>Display the palette as a <a href="CarpetDisplaying_the_Colour_Palette_on.htm">palette 
	 strip</a> not as a panel, as only the strip displays stencils.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Select menu option Palette -&gt; Stencil -&gt; On. 
	 Small buttons will appear next to each colour in the palette initially 
	 showing a cross (protected).</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>A tick in a stencil box means that you CAN draw on 
	 that colour. A cross means that you CANNOT draw on the colour as a 
	 stencil is protecting it. You can click on the stencil button to switch 
	 from protected to un-protected and vice-versa.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stencil Menu Options</span></p>
<p>Whilst the stencil feature is on, you can make the following selections 
 from the Palette -&gt; Stencil sub-menu:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>Select All - will automatically set all colours to 
	 un-protected which means you can draw on all palette colours. You 
	 can de-select individual colours in the usual way if you wish.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>De-select All - all colours will be made protected. 
	 You can then select individual colours that you wish to be able to 
	 draw on.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Invert - all previously selected colours will be de-selected 
	 and vice-versa.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Turning Stencil Off</span></p>
<p>To turn the stencil facility off, de-select menu item Palette -&gt; 
 Stencil -&gt; On - it should now not be ticked. If you re-select stencil 
 at a later time, your previously selected colours will be remembered.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stencil Regenerate</span></p>
<p>When you apply a stencil to a design, the stencil is created at that 
 particular time. If you then draw with a colour with a protected colour 
 then that area of colour will not be protected unless the palette is regenerated.</p>
<p>You can choose to <a href="Automatic_Refresh_Options.htm#Palette_Stencil">automatically 
 regenerate</a> the stencil every time the design is changed by selecting 
 the option in preferences. Alternatively, if you do not select the automatic 
 option, you can either select the menu option Palette -&gt; Stencil -&gt; 
 Regenerate Stencil or you can simply press letter 'P' on the keyboard 
 whenever you wish to regenerate the stencil.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Design</span></p>
<p>If a stencil exists for the existing design when you create a new design, 
 you have the option of turning the stencil area from the old design into 
 a <a href="CarpetCustom_Working_Area.htm">protected area</a> in the new 
 design.</p>
