<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Placing a Brush using the 
 Mouse</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can place single copies of a custom brush into the design as many 
 times as you wish.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Capture a brush</span></p>
<p>There are several ways to capture a custom brush so that you can draw 
 with it:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p><a href="CarpetCutting_a_Rectangular_Brush.htm">Cutting 
	 a Rectangular Brush</a> - The simplest and quickest method</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><a href="CarpetCutting_a_Freehand_Brush.htm">Cutting 
	 a Freehand Brush</a></p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><a href="CarpetCutting_a_Polygon_Brush.htm">Cutting 
	 a Polygon Brush</a></p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><a href="CarpetCutting_an_Elliptical_Brush.htm">Cutting 
	 an Elliptical Brush</a></p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Select it from the <a href="CarpetWorking_with_Shelves.htm">shelf</a> 
	 using the left hand button</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Paste a brush</span></p>
<p>Having captured a brush you can place it into the design as described 
 below.</p>
<ol>
	<li class="p"><p>If you want to make any colours in your brush <a href="CarpetMaking_Colours_Transparent.htm">transparent</a> 
	 (so that they will not be placed in your design) in addition to the 
	 background colour, do this now.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Choose the appropriate <a href="CarpetThe_Importance_of_Brush_Handles.htm">Brush 
	 Handle</a> .</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><a href="CarpetZooming_In_and_Out.htm">Zoom</a> in 
	 to the area in which you want to place the brush.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Float the brush over the design until it is in the 
	 correct place (either by visual judgement or by checking the cursorÂ’s 
	 co-ordinates in the <a href="CarpetUnderstanding_the_Status_Bar.htm">Status 
	 Bar</a> ).</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Click with the left-hand mouse button to place the 
	 design.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Place the brush in a shelf box (if it is not already 
	 there) if you think that you may want to use it again.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can also press the button and draw with it, dragging the pointer 
 across the screen. However, because of the time taken to draw a custom 
 brush, this may not produce smooth &quot;brush stroke&quot;.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right Hand Button</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you draw the brush using the right 
 hand button, then a solid colour version of the brush is drawn using the 
 current right hand button colour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This can be useful for certain design 
 effects such as creating a drop shadow (select black as the right hand 
 button colour then draw a black version of the brush using the right hand 
 button then the normal version on top offset slightly).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Many designs also feature a pale 
 version of the main motif in the background in a solid colour. You can 
 create this type of background by using the main motif as your brush and 
 selecting a pale colour for the right hand button colour, then drawing 
 the brush using the right hand button.</span> <span style="font-style: italic; 
													 font-weight: normal;">(Obviously 
 if you have already drawn foreground motifs you would have to use the 
 stencil feature so that only the background colour is overdrawn).</span></p>
