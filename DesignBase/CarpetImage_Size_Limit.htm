<h1>Size Limit</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The design size limit depends on the memory of the system that it is 
 being used on.</p>
<p>For RAM of 16GB, it is recommended that you do not exceed a design size 
 of approximately 20,000 ends x 20,000 rows or of any size where the number 
 of ends multiplied by the number of rows exceeds about 400MB.</p>
<p>The absolute maximim number of ends or rows (picks) in a design is 999,999 
 though it is not possible for width and length to be excessively large. 
 Thus you can create a very long and narrow design where one edge is over 
 100,000 ends or rows(picks) providing the total memory required is suitable 
 for the machine.</p>
<p>In extreme cases the software will allow a design to be viewed but not 
 edited as there is not enough memory.</p>
<p>You can check the amount of memory in your machine by using the menu 
 option Power Tools&gt;Memory Check.</p>
<p>Note that the following file types will NOT allow the size in either 
 ends or rows(picks) to exceed 65535:</p>
<p>.PAT, .EP, .CPT, .DES (Hardaker format), .TSF, .VCF, .KNF, .PCX</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make-Up</span></p>
<p>The APSO software package &quot;Make-Up&quot; is designed to take image 
 elements and multiply them to form larger designs. It can be useful for 
 combining border, and corner elements to make a large rug or any other 
 type of design from smaller sections in an easy and efficient way.</p>
