<h1>Ranges and Color Sets for Jacquard Designers</h1>
<p>A typical Warp Range tab in the Shade Library might look something like 
 this...</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ShadeLib_022.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">An example 
 of the Warp Range tab using the swatch option. The Range code is R500 
 and each of the colorways (A, B, C etc) has 6 colors. (Note there is no 
 set limit on the number of colors in a colorway and also, each one could 
 have a different number of colors though that will not normally happen. 
 &quot;Recolor Warp&quot; is selected which means that when a color set 
 is selected it will replace the current warp colors.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can display the above Warp Range tab or the Weft Range tab by selecting 
 Shade Library on the Palette menu (or press &lt;Shift&gt;+S ) see the 
 <a href="Shade_Library_Introduction.htm">Shade Library Introduction</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Range</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Select any range from the drop down list. 
 These range codes are taken from the Colors and Yarns data base.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Colorways List</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The 
 code for each color set is shown as a heading at the top of a column of 
 swatches forming the colorway. If there are a large number of colors in 
 one or more colorways, the software will display a vertical scroll bar 
 and if there are a large number of colorways (7 or more) there will be 
 a horizontal scroll bar as in the example above.</span></p>
<p>The Range list is used in exactly the same way as a normal list as described 
 for the <a href="Shade_Library_-_Color_Tab.htm">Color Tab</a>. Thus the 
 list can be scrolled by holding &lt;Shift&gt; and dragging it left right 
 or up and down. Also you can select colors by a Double-Click or by Drag 
 and Drop to the Palette but also you can select a whole colorway at a 
 time as described below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Recolor Artwork</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">This additional pair of radio buttons are 
 shown on the Warp Range and Weft Range tabs. If Recolor Artwork is selected, 
 &#160;the software will replace palette colors based on position in the 
 palette.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">R</span>ecolor 
 Warp or Weft</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">If this option is selected then color sets 
 will replace the current warp colors (or weft if using the Weft Range 
 tab). This option does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> affect 
 the Drag and Drop option for palette update.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Selecting a Colorway</p>
<p>The Range tabs allow a further method of recoloring a whole design (or 
 the warp or the weft) by selecting a complete color set ...</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Double Click on the Colorway Title (i.e. the Colorway Number)</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Hold &lt;<?rh-ignored text="Ctrl" ?>Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt; and 
	 click on the Colorway Title</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Drag and Drop from the Colorway Title to the Palette.</li>
</ol>
<p>Method 1+2 will replace artwork colors if &quot;Recolor Artwork&quot; 
 is selected (zero color if any is ignored) but will replace Warp colors 
 if &quot;Recolor Warp&quot; is selected. Similarly, on the Weft tab, Weft 
 colors are replaced if &quot;Recolor Weft&quot; is selected. (Replace 
 Warp or Weft is the initial default selection).</p>
<p>Method 3, since it is controlled by the mouse, gives an extra level 
 of control. You can drop on color 1 in the palette to do the same as options 
 1+2 but you can also replace/add colors further down the palette. In fact 
 the color set could be dropped <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> 
 the last palette color to add the entire color set to the end of the palette,</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Replacing Warp or Weft</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">When a color set is used to replace warp 
 or weft the entire color set will replace the current warp or weft colors 
 in the design. If there are not enough colors in the color set, then one 
 or more colors in the threading plan will be unchanged. On the other hand 
 if there are more colors in the color set than there are in the threading 
 plan, then the extra colors will be added both to the palette and to the 
 threading &#160;plan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Selecting a Color</p>
<p>The 4 methods of individual color selection also apply to Ranges/Colorways 
 i.e....</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Double Click on a Shade</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Hold &lt;<?rh-ignored text="Ctrl" ?>Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt; and 
	 click on a shade</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Type a shade code (or click on it once in the list) and press &lt;return&gt;</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Drag and Drop from the list to the Palette.</li>
</ol>
<p>As usual, for methods 1-3, the setting of the radio buttons for Add, 
 Replace, and Replace+Next is important</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
