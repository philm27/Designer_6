<h1>Borders</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>There are several features available which allow you to create designs 
 containing borders.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ribbons, Runners and Border Designs</span></p>
<p>A piece of design which is intended as a border in its own right can 
 be created as either a horizontal or vertical border.</p>
<p>This means that when you view the design using <a href="CarpetViewing_SingleMany_Design_Repeat.htm">View 
 Many</a>, it will only be repeated Horizontally or Vertically. To do this 
 select Horizontal or Vertical repeat in the Specification (repeat Type).</p>
<p>Note that you can also specify a drop match i.e. a Horizontal repeat 
 can have a drop and Vertical repeat can have a drop i.e. shift.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mirror and Wheel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you have created a Half Rug or 
 Scarf having a border and you need to create the whole design, you can 
 use the design <a href="CarpetMirroring_a_Design.htm">mirror</a> or the 
 design <a href="CarpetWheeling_a_Design.htm">wheel</a> option to do this.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mitre Corners</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you need to create a corner which 
 is mitered, you can use the mitering feature. This will effectively mirror 
 a corner of your design along a 45 degree diagonal line taking into account 
 the ends and rows(picks) per unit length.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Circular and Elliptical Borders</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">You can create a design having a 
 circular or elliptical border using the <a href="Circular_Borders.htm">Circular 
 Border</a> or the <a href="CarpetCreating_Elliptical_Borders.htm">Elliptical 
 Border</a> features. All you need to design is one repeat of the border 
 which should be a maximum size of one quarter of the whole thing.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pasting Borders</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Borders can, of course, be pasted 
 in using normal brushes but the <a href="CarpetPlacing_a_Brush_Numerically.htm">Numeric 
 Paste</a> feature has options to allow a brush to be repeated along one 
 edge.</span></p>
