<h1>Shelf Items and Undo</h1>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Undo History</p>
<p>Each shelf item has its own undo history so you can go back to a shelf 
 item and undo or redo changes for that one shelf item.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Recovering a deleted shelf item</p>
<p>However, since you can only use undo and redo for the current (i.e. 
 being edited) shelf item, a special menu option is provided so that you 
 can undo a shelf item delete. To recover a deleted shelf item right lick 
 on the shelf item and select Restore on the pop-up menu.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Palette Changes</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Palette changes may complicate undo. For 
 example if a shelf item is deleted that uses colors 8, 9 and 10 from the 
 palette, then these colors are deleted, the software will need to restore 
 these colors in order to Restore the shelf item.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">So you may get messages relating to this. 
 In many cases the software will be able to restore the shelf item but 
 in others it may not be possible.</p>
