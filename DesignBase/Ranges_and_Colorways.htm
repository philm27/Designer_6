<h1>Ranges and Colorways for Carpet Designers</h1>
<p>A typical Range tab might look something like this...</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ShadeLib_021.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">An example 
 of the Range tab using the loop option. The Range code is P515 and each 
 of the colorways (100, 120, 180 etc) has 6 colors. (Note there is no set 
 limit on the number of colors in a colorway and also, each one could have 
 a different number of colors though that will not normally happen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can display the above tab by selecting Shade Library on the Palette 
 menu (or press &lt;Shift&gt;+S ) see the <a href="Shade_Library_Introduction.htm">Shade 
 Library Introduction</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Range</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Select any range from the drop down list. 
 These range codes are taken from the Colors and Yarns data base.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Colorways List</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The 
 software will list all colorways in the above format in which the Colorway 
 is shown as a heading at the top a column of swatches forming the colorway. 
 If there are a large number of colors in one or more colorways, the software 
 will display a vertical scroll bar and if there are a large number of 
 colorways (7 or more) there will be a horizontal scroll bar as in the 
 example above.</span></p>
<p>The Range list is used in exactly the same way as a normal list as described 
 for the <a href="Shade_Library_-_Color_Tab.htm">Color Tab</a>. Thus the 
 list can be scrolled by holding &lt;Shift&gt; and dragging it left right 
 or up and down. Also you can select colors by a Double-Click or by Drag 
 and Drop to the Palette but also you can select a whole colorway at a 
 time as described below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Selecting a Colorway</p>
<p>The 3 methods of color selection also apply to Ranges/Colorways with 
 one small difference...</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Double Click on the Colorway Title (i.e. the Colorway Number)</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Hold &lt;<?rh-ignored text="Ctrl" ?>Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt; and 
	 click on the Colorway Title.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Drag and Drop from the Colorway Title to the Palette.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note methods 1+2 will do a strict color replacement in the palette starting 
 at color 1 (zero color if any is ignored)</p>
<p>Method 3, since it is controlled by the mouse gives an extra level of 
 control. You can drop on color 1 in the palette to do the same as options 
 1+2 but you can also replace/add colors further down the palette. In fact 
 the color set could be dropped <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> 
 the last palette color to add the entire color set to the end of the palette,</p>
