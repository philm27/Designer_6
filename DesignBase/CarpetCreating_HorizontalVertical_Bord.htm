<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Creating Horizontal/Vertical 
 Borders</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>There are many functions to help you design horizontal and vertical 
 borders.</p>
<p>Before starting your border, select a horizontal or vertical <a href="CarpetSelecting_a_Repeat_Type.htm">repeat 
 type</a> from the <a href="Specification_Dialog.htm">specification window</a> 
 .</p>
<p>Having designed one repeating section of your border and you wish to 
 make the design into more than one repeat, then the easiest method is 
 to use <a href="CarpetDuplicating_EndsRows.htm">duplicate</a>. Alternatively 
 you could use <a href="CarpetPlacing_a_Brush_Numerically.htm">Numeric 
 Paste</a>.</p>
<p>For uneven qualities Â– if you want to turn a horizontal border into 
 a vertical one (or vice versa) then you can <a href="CarpetRotating_a_Design.htm">rotate 
 it</a> whilst keeping the quality constant.</p>
<p>To create corner sections, try mitering. <a href="CarpetMirroring_a_Design_Diagonally_Mi.htm">Mitre 
 the design</a> to give you a mirror image diagonally across the corners 
 making the border run along the adjacent edge.</p>
<p>Use Design-&gt;Mirror to mirror in any direction to quickly complete 
 the border. For example if you have completed the bottom left quarter, 
 mirror left to right then bottom to top to complete the other 3 quarters.</p>
<p>Alternatively, many rug designs may involve completing, say, the bottom 
 half then <a href="CarpetWheeling_a_Design.htm">wheeling</a> the bottom 
 half to the top through 180 degrees.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Occasionally you may need to &quot;break&quot; 
 a brush in the middle, bending it to any angle for example to make a section 
 for a hexagon etc.. To do this make a brush representing two sides of 
 the figure then select Brush-&gt;Mitre which allows selection of an angle. 
 This function cuts out and discards a triangular segment from the middle 
 of the brush so that it can be folded downwards to a maximum of 90 degrees.</p>
