<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Undo Size Warnings</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You will find the <a href="CarpetUsing_UndoRedo.htm">Undo</a> Size Warning 
 option in Undo Preferences (menu option Edit-&gt;Undo Preferences-&gt;Warnings) 
 on the Warnings tab.</p>
<p>A drawing operation such as a short line or short freehand operation 
 with a small brush does not take up very much memory in the undo buffer. 
 However, if the design is very large, some actions such as fill, global 
 colour change or large circles for example, can use up large amounts of 
 memory.</p>
<p>For this reason, the undo buffer warning gives you the opportunity not 
 to commit a design alteration to the undo memory and you can set the design 
 section size that will cause a warning to appear.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note that you may obviate this problem 
 to a large extent by requesting that undo history items are compressed 
 - see the</span> <a href="Undo_Preferences_-_Advanced.htm"><span style="font-style: italic;">Advanced</span></a> 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">tab in undo preferences.</span></p>
<p>In the Undo tab, select a default Undo Buffer Warning Size  the options 
 are</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>No warnings  not normally recommended as you may 
	 run out of undo memory without prior warning</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Large (20MB)  display a warning if the operation 
	 would use 20MB or more of memory.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Medium (10MB)  display a warning if the operation 
	 would use 10MB or more of memory.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Small (5MB) - display a warning if the operation would 
	 use 5MB or more of memory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a warning does appear whilst you are working, it means that the alteration 
 you have just made to the design will take up more undo memory than your 
 default selection.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>YES - If you want to be able to undo the operation 
	 - click on Yes.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>NO - If you do NOT want to be able to undo the operation, 
	 thereby saving memory - select No.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>CANCEL - If you would rather abandon the drawing operation 
	 - select Cancel.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The CANCEL option is useful if you 
 would like to save the design to disk before performing the drawing operation.</span></p>
