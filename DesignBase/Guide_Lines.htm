<h1>Guide Lines</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Guide Lines are simply any Polygon Lines or groups of lines that are 
 designated as Guide Lines. They have a special status in that they can 
 be made visible by selecting View-&gt;Guide Lines on the menu.</p>

<p>Example design showing a 12 foot octagonal rug and the beginnings of 
 the design. Guide Lines have been created using the &quot;<a href="Polygons_-_Standard_Shapes.htm">Standard 
 Shapes</a>&quot; feature.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can change a polygon to a Guide Line (or back to a normal polygon 
 line) by going into polygon mode and then either:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Use Properties</p>
<p>Right click any point on the Polygon then select Properties and check 
 the &quot;Guide Line&quot; option</p>
<p>You may also select a different colour for the polygon line (this is 
 not the same as the design color when and if the line is rendered into 
 the design). Generally speaking Guide lines will be drawn in a vibrant 
 color that will stand out against all others in the design as here.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Use the Guide Line Button</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Select any point on the Polygon using the 
 left mouse button.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Use Tape Measure</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Whenever the Tape Measure Tool is used 
 you can check the &quot;Keep Lines as Guide&quot; option. In this case 
 the software actually creates a group of 5 lines since a small cross is 
 created at each end of the main line. The software will automatically 
 give the group a name containing the line length.</p>
