<h1>Normal Working Area</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The normal working area is specified by the edges of the design window. 
 Within this area you can use any designing tools. Once you go beyond the 
 boundary of the design area the <a href="CarpetCursorType_Default.htm">cursor</a> 
 changes from a cross-hair to an arrow - ready for you to make a selection 
 in the toolbox or palette etc.</p>
<p>If you are working in a <a href="CarpetZooming_In_and_Out.htm">zoom 
 level</a> that allows you to see an entire single design repeat - when 
 you place a <a href="CarpetPlacing_a_Brush_using_the_Mouse.htm">brush</a> 
 over the normal working area boundary, you will see the brush wrap around 
 the design and appear at the opposite edge (its position at this edge 
 will depend on your match type). This allows you to see the effect in 
 the design if you were to actually draw the brush at that location and 
 to adjust the position slightly by moving the mouse before committing 
 to the design.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note that if the repeat type is Horizontal, 
 wrap around only occurs width wise and in a vertical repeat it only occurs 
 across the top and bottom edges. In the case of a rug, wrap around does 
 not occur in any direction.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you are working at a high zoom level, and 
 cannot see a full repeat, the part of the brush that goes beyond the normal 
 working area will still be placed on your design even though you cannot 
 see it until you zoom out.</p>
