<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Cutting a Freehand Brush</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Use this tool to cut roughly around figures in the design where the 
 rectangular cut cannot be used because of the proximity of other shapes.</p>
<p>To cut a freehand brush, follow these steps:-</p>
<ol>
	<li class="p"><p>Click on the <img src="btncutfreehand.gif" alt="" 
										 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; 
										 margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" 
										 width="23" height="23" border="0" /> 
	 button in the <a href="CarpetUsing_the_Toolbox.htm">toolbox</a> , 
	 or alternatively use the <a href="CarpetUsing_Keyboard_Shortcuts.htm">keyboard 
	 shortcut</a> <span style="font-weight: bold;">CTRL</span> and <span 
	 style="font-weight: bold;">D</span>.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p><a href="CarpetZooming_In_and_Out.htm">Zoom</a> in 
	 to the area of your design from which you want to cut your brush.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Put <a href="CarpetScrolling_around_the_Design.htm">Autoscroll</a> 
	 on (if you canÂ’t see all of the area that you want to cut on screen).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li class="p"><p>Select the required <a href="CarpetSelecting_a_Background_Colour.htm">background 
	 colour</a> . This colour will be transparent when you pick up your 
	 brush. If you are cutting out a motif, and want to leave the background 
	 behind (for instance, you may want to pick up a floral group from 
	 a plain ground), then ensure that the design background colour is 
	 selected as your current background colour. You can then draw quite 
	 roughly around the shape, rather than going carefully around the outline.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Draw around the shape to be cut, holding down the 
	 left-hand mouse button as you draw. When you release the button the 
	 start and finish points of your line will be connected and the brush 
	 will be created.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li class="p"><p>If you want to make any colours within the brush <a 
	 href="CarpetMaking_Colours_Transparent.htm">transparent</a> , do it 
	 at this stage.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>The brush will now be displayed in the toolbox. Either 
	 place it elsewhere in the design or place it into a <a href="CarpetStoring_Brushes_in_Shelves.htm">shelf 
	 box</a> .</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The brush will remain current until you select 
 another brush from the toolbox or until you cut another brush from the 
 design or select one from the shelf.</p>
