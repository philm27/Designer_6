<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Paths Folders and File Names</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Designs, projects, palettes, exported files and frame plant guides are 
 all saved as files within directories, also known as folders.</p>
<p>Use folders to keep your work ordered and easy to find.</p>
<p>You can find out more about creating folders <a href="CarpetCreating_Folders.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Path</span></p>
<p>The full folder and file name is often called the path and may look 
 something like this:</p>
<p>c:\Jacquard\production\AA5378.PRJ</p>
<p>c:\Jacquard\palettes\Spring1.PAL</p>
<p>In the first example above, the file AA5378.PRJ is located in the &quot;production&quot; 
 folder which is contained within the &quot;Jacquard&quot; folder which 
 in turn is contained within drive &quot;c:&quot;.</p>
<p>Similarly the file Spring1.PAL is in the &quot;palettes&quot; folder 
 which is also contained within the &quot;Jacquard&quot; folder which in 
 turn is contained within drive &quot;c:&quot;.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">File Extension</span></p>
<p>The file extension - a dot followed normally by a 3 character code - 
 follows the main part of the file name and identifies the type of file. 
 Thus project files for example have the .PRJ file extension and palette 
 files have the .PAL extension. However, the file extension is strictly 
 speaking part of the file name.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Limits</span></p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of directory levels although the full 
 path cannot exceed 260 characters.</p>
<p>Also, there is no limit to the number of folders and files within a 
 folder. Each folder and file name must of course be unique within the 
 parent folder.</p>
