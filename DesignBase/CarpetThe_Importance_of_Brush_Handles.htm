<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The brush handle controls the point at which a custom brush is held 
 when <a href="CarpetPlacing_a_Brush_using_the_Mouse.htm">placing</a> it 
 in a design. It is an important facility as it will help you to place 
 brushes easily and accurately.</p>
<p>To change the current handle simply select one of the nine possible 
 handles from the menu e.g. Brush-&gt;Handle-&gt;Centre.</p>
<p>Note that you can also set the default handle for a new brush using 
 preferences. To do this select Edit-&gt;Preferences from the menu and 
 then the &quot;Brush&quot; tab.</p>
<p>Note that the Status Bar indicates the current handle location (immediately 
 to the left of the Designe size information). See the topic <a href="CarpetUnderstanding_the_Status_Bar.htm">Status 
 Bar</a>.</p>
<p>You can choose to hold your brush by any of its four corners, at the 
 centre of one edge or by its centre point. The cursors co-ordinates (displayed 
 in the Status Bar) relate to the point at which the brush is held.</p>
<p>Brush handle type also affects placement of brushes when you <a href="CarpetFilling_with_a_Brush.htm">fill 
 an area with a brush</a> .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">When you fill an area with a custom brush, 
 it fills outwards from the point designated by the handle type. For instance, 
 if you had selected a top left handle, the brush would fill out and down 
 from the top left-hand corner of your design. If you are filling an area 
 within your design, rather than the whole area of your design, the brush 
 still fills invisibly from the corners/centre of your design (it does 
 not fill from the corners/centre of the area to be filled).</p>
