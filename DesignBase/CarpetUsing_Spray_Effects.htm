 If you double click the spray button the following dialog will be displayed 
 allowing greater control of the spray feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="SprayControlDlg.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; 
									 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; 
									 margin-right: 0px;" width="305" height="340" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In this 
 example a multi coloured spray has been selected made up of 2 parts palette 
 colour 4 and 1 part palette colour 5. The spray area is circular with 
 a diameter of 60 pixels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span></p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>Spray Diameter  this specifies the diameter of the 
	 spray circle (or square) in ends. Note that if the quality or setting 
	 is not &quot;square set&quot; then this is taken into account and 
	 therefore the length of the shape area in rows or picks may be a different 
	 figure.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Spray Speed  this controls the speed at which the 
	 random &quot;droplets&quot; are sprayed onto the design. The minimum 
	 value and slowest speed is 2 and the higher the value, the faster 
	 the spray.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Circular/Square Spray  if this is unchecked, the 
	 spray area will be square.</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Multi Coloured Spray  this is an exciting feature 
	 that lets you use as many of the palette colours as you wish and in 
	 any proportion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multi-Colour Spray</span></p>
<p>If you select Multi Coloured Spray, your palette colours will appear 
 in the panel at the bottom of the dialog. All colours will initially be 
 &quot;Unused&quot;. if you click on a colour in the list with the left 
 mouse button you can then change the proportion of that colour. The simplest 
 way to do this is to click on the up or down arrows in the Proportion 
 box. Alternatively you can key in a new figure using the keyboard.</p>
<p>It is the relative values of the proportion figures that matters rather 
 than the actual value. The software will add up all the values given and 
 work out the percentage for each one.</p>
<p>You can use simple proportions, for example, set each of 3 colours to 
 a proportion of 1 to give a spray consisting of one third of each colour. 
 In this latter case it does not matter what the value is as long as all 
 3 are equal.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could use a more complex proportion, for example set 
 2 colours to 68 and 32. Since the total is 100 then one colour is actually 
 68% and the other is 32%.</p>
<p>To clear all proportion values, click on &quot;Clear All&quot;.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plain Coloured Spray</span></p>
<p>If you dont select Multi Coloured Spray, the spray colour will be governed 
 by your currently used <a href="CarpetSelecting_a_Foreground_Colour.htm">foreground</a> 
 and <a href="CarpetSelecting_a_Background_Colour.htm">background</a> colours.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CTRL key feature</span></p>
<p>If you hold down the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CTRL</span> key 
 as you apply the spray, the spray will be made up of all the colours that 
 come within the diameter of the spray. If you want to soften a join from 
 one colour to another, spray down the join with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CTRL</span> 
 key held down (using a fairly small spray diameter). This will break up 
 the straight edge, so that the two colours gradually merge from one to 
 the other.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Brush</span></p>
<p>Note that Spray uses the current <a href="CarpetUsing_Different_Brushes.htm">brush</a> 
 or <a href="CarpetCustom_Brushes.htm">custom brush</a> so you can spray 
 with any size from the tool box or you can create a custom brush or choose 
 one from the shelf.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Digitiser</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you are working with a pen and digitiser, 
 you can set the Digitiser Pressure Settings to give you a variable spray 
 rate and size  depending on how much pressure is applied with the pen 
 on the digitiser.</p>
