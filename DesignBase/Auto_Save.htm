<h1>Auto Save - Features</h1>
<p>Auto Save is controlled by a new set of <a href="Undo_Preferences_-_Auto_Save.htm">Undo 
 Preferences</a> and by two menu options on the File Menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="AutoSaveMenuItems.gif" alt=""

<p>The main features of the Auto Save system are:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timed Auto Save</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">You can specify that the software 
 should save the project at specified intervals, for example every 10 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The software will only do an Auto 
 Save, however, if a change has been made to the design (including an undo). 
 In this way you will keep a selection of different designs if you are 
 away from your desk for a protracted period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The software will wait until a drawing 
 operation is complete before doing an auto save. This also applies to 
 all menu operations such as Circular Borders, Mirrors etc which can take 
 several minutes in some cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Also, the software will restart the 
 timer if you do a manual Auto Save. For example you can force an Auto 
 Save after a particularly complex set of design modifications. The software 
 will then re-start the timer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forced Auto Save</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">You can force an Auto Save at any 
 time, even if you are not using the timed Auto Save feature by selecting 
 menu option Auto Save as shown in the illustration above. Alternatively 
 you can use keyboard shortcut &lt;Ctrl&gt;+\ which on most keyboards is 
 2 keys very close together at the bottom left of the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This latter method provides a fast 
 and easy way to save your work. You do not need to worry about a folder 
 or a unique name for the file.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Save Folder</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is nominated in <a href="Undo_Preferences_-_Auto_Save.htm">Undo 
 Preferences (Auto Save Page)</a> and it is recommended that a very simple 
 path is used such as c:\autosaves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">All auto saves are made to this folder 
 but you will normally not need to navigate to it as its content can be 
 listed using the menu option &quot;Auto Save Files List&quot; as shown 
 in the illustration above. This displays a list of all current Auto Save 
 files. More details of this dialog can be found in the topic <a href="Auto_Save_List.htm">Auto 
 Save List</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">File Format .prjasf</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The auto save files themselves will 
 have file extension .prjasf and are a variation on the prj file. Like 
 the prj file, they hold all the project information. The prjasf format 
 is designed as a fast and economical (on memory requirements) file save 
 method.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">These files can in fact be loaded 
 using any Open File dialog but it is recommended that they are only loaded 
 using the Auto Save file list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">These files are obviously not intended 
 for long term storage and cannot be loaded by previous versions of the 
 software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Save File Names</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Auto Save file names are automatically 
 generated and are in the following form:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">904562Red_34.prjasf</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The software simply takes the file 
 name (904562Red in this case being the file name without the .prj extension) 
 and adds a project version number and file extension (_34.prj).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version Number</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">As far as possible, projects will 
 keep the version number sequence for the whole of their life and it will 
 be incremented every time the project is saved whether by a normal save 
 or an Auto Save.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This version number may restart at 
 1 in certain circumstances such as when &quot;Save As&quot; is used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The preferences allow you to specify 
 the number of Auto Save files which you wish to retain. A useful number 
 to use is 3 although you could keep 6 10 or even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">After creating an Auto Save file, 
 the software will retain the most recent 3 files (if 3 is the number to 
 retain) and delete any older ones, thus, in this case, you will always 
 have the most recent 3 Auto Save files.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Keeping more files does not affect 
 the performance of the software in any way other than a little more disk 
 space will be used.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><img 
	 src="AutoSaveListMsg.gif" alt="" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; 
	 margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" width="378" height="119" border="0" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Save List on Start up</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Every time you start the software, 
 it will check if there are any auto save files in the nominated folder. 
 If there aren't any, the software will simply start up normally, otherwise 
 the software will ask if you want to see the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The reason for this is that the software 
 does not know if there was a problem when the software was last used and 
 thus does not automatically delete them when it is started up or closed 
 down. You may want to access these files via the <a href="Auto_Save_List.htm">Auto 
 Save List</a> and, if there were no problems, you may wish to tidy up 
 the old files which are not now required. This &quot;Tidying up&quot; 
 can be done at any time by accessing the Auto Save List.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Deleting all Auto Save files is a 
 simple, one click, operation. Alternatively you can easily select all 
 files in a project or individual files. See the topic <a href="Auto_Save_List.htm">Auto 
 Save List</a> for more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adopted History</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Note that if you are continuing to 
 work on the same project or projects when starting up the software, you 
 can leave the Auto Save files there as they will be &quot;adopted&quot; 
 as part of the history when you load a project normally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This means that the software will 
 automatically delete the oldest file even if that is from a previous session 
 when a new file is saved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The project version number sequence 
 will also be continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opening an Auto Save File</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">To load a .prjasf file simply switch 
 to the required project, display the Auto Save File list, select the required 
 file and click on Open. If you wish to develop this design further, you 
 should immediately do a Save As to a normal directory with a new name 
 as the current name will contain the serial number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you try to do a save with the 
 same name or to the Auto Save Folder, the software will display a message 
 advising against it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">You cannot save a .prjasf file using 
 normal Save or Save As etc.</span></p>
