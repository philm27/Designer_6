<h1><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Storing Brushes on the Shelf</span></span></h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>By far the simplest way to store a brush on the shelf is to create a 
 <a href="CarpetCustom_Brushes.htm">brush</a> by any method then click 
 on an empty shelf box with the left-hand mouse button.</p>
<p>However, if a box already contains an image, you need to either delete 
 it first, or use the pop-up menu option &quot;Brush To Shelf&quot; which 
 will delete the existing shelf item first if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ShelfPopup_001.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">The 
 shelf pop-up menu is displayed by clicking on the shelf with the right 
 hand mouse button.</span></p>
<p>When you want to re-select the shelf item as a brush, either:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="p"><p>Click on the appropriate shelf item with the left-hand 
	 mouse button</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Select the pop-up menu option &quot;Brush From Shelf&quot;</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Select main menu option Shelf-&gt;Copy to Brush. A 
	 dialog will be displayed in which you can specify the shelf item number.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these operations select the item as the current brush whilst 
 leaving a copy of it in the shelf for future use.</p>
<p>For further details about creating brushes, see the topic <a href="CarpetCustom_Brushes.htm">Create 
 a custom brush</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duplicate Shelf Item</span></p>
<p>The simplest way to duplicate a shelf item (i.e. copy it to another 
 shelf item) is to make the item into the current brush by selecting it 
 using the left-hand mouse button and then drop it into one or more empty 
 shelf items, again using the left-hand button in each case.</p>
<p>You can even select the current design as a brush.</p>
<p>It can be useful to duplicate the &quot;edit box&quot; if you want to 
 compare a design before and after an alteration. Duplicate the design 
 before making the alteration, and then if you wish to return to the original 
 version you can simply select your duplicate as the &quot;edit <a href="CarpetTurning_a_Shelf_in_to_the_Main_D.htm">box</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Some easy to use menu options are provided for copying Box 1 (the main 
 design) to another box as this is a common requirement. To use this method, 
 click with the right-hand mouse button on the empty shelf item to display 
 the Pop-up shelf menu and select menu item Copy from Box 1 to copy the 
 main design to that box. Alternatively, select main menu option Shelf-&gt;Copy 
 from Box 1 and nominate which shelf box you want to copy to in the resulting 
 dialog.</p>
