<h1>Polygons - Create new Shapes - Size</h1>
<p>This is the Size tab on the &quot;Create New Shape&quot; Property Sheet. 
 Use it to specify the size of the shape (before any rotation takes place).</p>
<p>For more general information see the topic <a href="Polygons_-_Standard_Shapes.htm">Polygons 
 - Standard Shapes</a> and for some examples of different shapes see the 
 topic <a href="Polygons_-_Create_new_Shapes_-_Shapes.htm">Shapes</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Poly_STD_Size_001.png" alt=""

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt;">An example 
 of the Size tab - the user has selected &quot;Width as Design&quot; and 
 &quot;Length as Design&quot; as this is the simplest way to make the shape 
 fit to the design size. Some shapes cannot always fill the design size 
 such as regular polygons and circles.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Units</p>
<p>Choose the units for the figures in the dialog from the drop down list 
 (Mtrs, cm, mm, Yds, ft, ins).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Radius</p>
<p>For circles and Ellipses (and arcs and chords) you can specify the radius 
 of the figure (only one axis for a circle). This figure will automatically 
 change in tandem with the Size figure. For regular polygons you can specify 
 the length of the radial lines here. For Arcs and Chords the figure is 
 the radius of the circle or ellipse on which the arc or chord is based.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Size</p>
<p>For circles, only the width of the figure needs to be entered. For all 
 other figures, both a width and a length can be specified although for 
 some shapes they are tied together such as a regular pentagon 5 sided 
 figure. Sizes are always specified before rotation. For Arcs and Chords 
 the figure is the size of the circle or ellipse on which the arc or chord 
 is based.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Width as Design</p>
<p>Check this box to change the width of the figure to that of the design. 
 For some figures such as Circles and Regular Polygons, this will also 
 change the length.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Length as Design</p>
<p>Check this box to change the length of the figure to that of the design. 
 For some figures such as Circles and Regular Polygons, this will also 
 change the width</p>
<p>.</p>
