<h1>Re-size</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you need to increase the physical design size, use the re-size facility. 
 This feature will &quot;blow-up&quot; the design size or reduce it as 
 opposed to adding on additional border space or cropping it.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If you need to change the quality 
 of your design whilst keeping it the same physical size and proportions, 
 then use</span> <a href="CarpetRedrafting.htm"><span style="font-style: italic;">re-draft</span></a> 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">rather than re-size.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Design Size Any</p>
<p>Select the menu item Design-&gt;Size-&gt;Any. The following dialog will 
 be displayed.</p>
<ol>
	<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"><p style="text-align: center;">&#160;</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Resize_001.png" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8.0pt;">The 
 illustration above shows the dialog with &quot;Keep Proportions&quot; 
 checked. This means that if one figure is changed, the other will also 
 change automatically, in this case to produce an increase of 9.375%.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><img src="Resize_002.png" 
														 alt="" style="border: none;" 
														 border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">This 
 example shows the dialog with Feet and Inches selected. As is shown here, 
 separate edit boxes are shown for the feet and inches values for both 
 width and length.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To use the dialog, select the required units 
 if not already displayed, then enter the new size and Click OK. If you 
 click on Cancel, no changes will be made to the design size.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The original size is shown for reference and 
 the new size is shown in &quot;points&quot;, feet and inches and Metric 
 units at the bottom, also for reference.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Units</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Select the required units from the 4 options 
 list i.e. Ends/Rows, Feet and Inches, Metres or %.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">In the case of %, a value of 100 is &quot;no 
 change&quot; and 110 for example would be 10% bigger and 90 would be 10% 
 smaller. </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">If you switch between different units after 
 having entered new size values, they will be converted to the new units.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">All values except for ends, rows and feet 
 can be entered to 3 decimal places.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smart Draw</span></p>
<p>Smart Draw will attempt to smooth out jagged edges when increasing the 
 design size. It has no effect when reducing the design size. Note however 
 that the result is of course computer-generated and may still need a designers' 
 eye to perfect it. For more information about Smart Draw see the topic 
 <a href="CarpetRedrafting.htm">Redraft</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Insert Blank Lines</span></p>
<p>Insert Blank Lines does just what it says, the lines being inserted 
 in the background palette colour. If, for example, you re-size your design 
 from 252 x 252 to 252 x 288, your re-sized design will have 36 equally 
 spaced horizontal rows inserted into it. Also, in this example, the new 
 image will start with 7 original rows then an inserted row. This will 
 be repeated 36 times.</p>
<p>This has no effect if the length of the design is being reduced, and 
 also note that Smart Draw cannot be used at the same time and will be 
 greyed out. Similarly, if Blank Lines is selected, Smart Draw cannot be 
 used and will be greyed out.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Percentage Option</span></p>
<p>Select this feature if you want to enter the new design size as a percentage 
 of the old.</p>
<p>In this case you would enter for example 200% in order to double the 
 design size or 50% to halve it etc..</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep Proportions</span></p>
<p>Select this option in order to automatically decrease or increase rows 
 by the same percentage when editing ends and vice versa.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Double Design Size</p>
<p>This main menu option (Design-&gt;Size-&gt;Double) will automatically 
 blow-up the design size to double its original size in both width and 
 length without needing to use the dialog.</p>
<p>Smart Draw will always be used if applicable.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Half Design Size</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">This main menu option (Design-&gt;Size-&gt;Half) 
 will automatically re-size the design to half its original size.</p>
