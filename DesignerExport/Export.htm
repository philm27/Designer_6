<h1>Export - Carpet Designer Vs Jacquard Designer</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Using Carpet Designer</p>
<p>If the design has no special effects you can use Carpet Designer to 
 produce the .bin files required for punching the VERDOL cards.</p>
<p>If the frame plan contains planted frames (i.e. frames containing more 
 than one color) then a frame plan MUST be created before the design is 
 exported as a BIN file.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the frames are all single colour then the frame 
 plan is optional as far as the file export is concerned, as you can use 
 the palette as the frame order.</p>
<p>Special Effects, except for &quot;no yarn&quot; (where a <a href="DesignerBase.chm::/Zero_Colour.htm">Zero 
 Colour</a> occurs in the design) cannot be created.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using Jacquard Designer</span></p>
<p>If a design requires special effects you must use Jacquard Designer 
 to produce the .bin or .ep files. Special effects in this case refer to 
 things like &quot;Keep over 2 wires&quot; etc.</p>
<p>You must go through the process of applying weaves to the design before 
 the file can be exported.</p>
<p>If it is simply a case of using &quot;Through to Back&quot; instead 
 of &quot;Not through to Back&quot; or a similar overall change in the 
 weaves then this can be accomplished by creating a separate Format File 
 and then using Carpet Designer to export the files which is slightly easier 
 than applying weaves in the Jacquard program. See the topic <a href="Export_-_Format_Files.htm">Format 
 Files</a>.</p>
