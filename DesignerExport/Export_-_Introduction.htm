<h1>Export - Overview</h1>
<p>The Export feature allows both Carpet Designer and Jacquard Designer 
 to create files suitable for use by various loom types. These include 
 the BIN files for certain punch machines and the EP files for Van de Wiele 
 electronic jacquards.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">These features are an optional extra 
 and may be disabled or not visible on your menus. To find out more contact 
 your sales representative.</span></p>
<p>Files can be created by both the CarpetDesigner and the JacquardDesigner 
 programs but not by the Textile Designer program.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Format Files</p>
<p>These give the software important information for Carpet users such 
 as the number of frames, the number of holes per frame, the number of 
 picks (cards) per design row and the actual positions of each end and 
 frame in the card. More details are given at the end of this document.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weaves</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Weave files are only required if 
 Jacquard Designer is being used. If Carpet Designer is to be used then 
 the weaves are determined from information in the Format File.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Features - General</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Format Files</span> - The System uses 
 <span style="font-weight: normal;">Format Files</span> which are simple 
 .txt files that may be edited or created using Notepad. All details of 
 the punching or electronic jacquard file requirements are contained within 
 these files.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Punch Code</span> - The Format file 
 specifies the <span style="font-weight: normal;">punch code</span> (or 
 lifts or electronic code) for selected and non selected frames on each 
 of the 2 possible cards (or picks) therefore it is easy to create a Format 
 for variations such as &quot;Through to Back&quot; or &quot;Not through 
 to Back&quot; etc.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto-Repeat</span> - The design itself 
 need not be made up to the width of the loom. The software will <span 
	 style="font-weight: normal;">automatically repeat</span> it out widthwise 
 and will automatically take account of a repeat drop match. (However, 
 if the design uses the new &quot;Brick&quot; repeat feature it must be 
 converted to a self match (i.e. straight match) before the Export option 
 is used).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Repeats</span> - If the design 
 does not fit into the width of the loom a whole number of times, the software 
 will offer the option of starting the output file at any design end therefore 
 creating a <span style="font-weight: normal;">partial repeat</span> at 
 the left and/or right hand side.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Zero Colour<a name="Zero_Colour" id="Zero_Colour"></a></span> 
 - In Carpet Designer, the <a href="DesignerBase.chm::/Zero_Colour.htm">Zero 
 Colour</a> may be used to indicate where all yarn is to be woven in the 
 back.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Features - Verdol Papers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Header Cards</span> - A header card 
 or cards can be punched in which the design name, Card Set number and 
 card count will be punched in a readable form. The third header card onwards, 
 if punched, will have every frame selected so that these cards can be 
 made to overlap the last few cards and glued to make a card loop.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Card Numbers</span> - may be punched, 
 again in readable form, in unused card columns. The software automatically 
 selects unused columns in which to punch the card numbers</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reverse Sequence</span> - Cards can 
 be written in reverse sequence or normal sequence.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Selected Range</span> - Specific cards 
 can be written to the export files making it easy to re-punch a small 
 number of cards in a particular set if they have been damaged.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Selected Sets</span> - All sets may 
 be written to the exported file or files or a specific range of sets. 
 For example if there are normally 6 sets A - F, each set representing 
 a 2 foot width of carpet, you could request only set D or perhaps set 
 D-F to be exported (and subsequently punched).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Minimum Cards</span> - A minimum number 
 of cards can be specified. This can be useful since a certain number of 
 cards may be required to fit around the drum on the loom.</p>
